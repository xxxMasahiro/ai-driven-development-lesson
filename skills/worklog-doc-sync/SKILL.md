# Worklog Doc Sync

## Sync Order

Initial creation:

```text
docs/product/REQUIREMENTS.md
docs/product/SPECIFICATION.md
docs/product/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md
docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md
```

Later change:

```text
docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md
docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md
implementation or deletion
docs/product/REQUIREMENTS.md
docs/product/SPECIFICATION.md
docs/product/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.MD`.
2. Confirm whether this is initial creation or later change.
3. Before product-repository development or product-document edits, prompt the learner to open a separate Ubuntu/WSL CLI window for the configured product workspace. The STEP 1-14 default is `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository/`, but Free Development, Product Improvement, and External Integration must use the workspace selected by lesson configuration and Dashboard Settings.
4. Read the existing related files before proposing edits.
5. Present an update plan before writing protected product documents.
6. Do not write unfinished decisions into the three design documents.
7. After sync, route to `skills/lesson-sync-gate/SKILL.md` for validation.
