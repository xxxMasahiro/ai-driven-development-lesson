# TASK_TRACKER.md

## Current Status

The lesson repository includes mechanical enforcement, flexible lesson entry, Free Development Mode, Team Development and Docker advanced module, dialogue-centered learning, as-built synchronization checks, sub-agent review protocol, menu/dashboard/illustration entry points, 7-day and 14-day lesson language controls, and lesson-side aggregate testing.

The previous implemented change promotes the Git workflow policy into a shared menu-level policy for menu items 1 through 7, including branch permission, `git worktree` permission, direct-main permission, automation level, Git monitoring, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
The previous implemented change added user-configurable Git workflow policy settings and the as-built sync contract that mechanically enforces synchronization across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
The current implemented Git workflow action settings split Git workflow behavior into detailed settings for commit, push, PR creation, PR CI monitoring, merge execution, developer-responsibility auto-merge, main CI monitoring, and local/remote sync monitoring.
The current implemented Git hooks policy provides faster safe serial pre-commit operation through `full`, `fast`, and `minimal` modes, conservative Git-local caching, and a path-based local full/no-cache recommendation command.
The current implemented local verification scope policy records that everyday test execution must follow workflow contracts, change scope, and user approval, with heavy recommended checks presented before execution.
The current implemented resource-budgeted parallel guard provides safe optional parallel execution decisions for Git hooks, Playwright, CI, and aggregate checks through user-configured memory and swap budgets.
The current implemented test and CI safe time optimization first phase adds observe-only Test Plan Manifest behavior, Coverage Guard, Result Attestation, CI-safe Git hooks parallelism, and lightweight fixture-copy optimization while preserving full/no-cache verification.
The current implemented learner context foundation provides validated source documents under `learning/context/` plus `tools/lesson-context`.
The current implemented learner context runtime integration connects `tools/lesson` and `tools/lesson14` status output to read-only context summaries while keeping Free Development Mode as a workflow, not a lesson.
The current implemented Security guard backfill adds repository-level security invariants, a policy table, a reusable checker, standalone tests, aggregate-test wiring, Git hooks wiring, CI wiring, and pre-commit wiring.
The current implemented product security workflow gate adds `tools/product-security status|preflight|advise|check|gate` for menu items 4, 5, and 6 while preserving their existing document, repository-boundary, Git sync, CI, and approval gates.
The current implemented CI timing and approved auto-improvement cycle records measured final common aggregate/full-hooks timing, strengthens CI status targeting, provides read-only improvement proposals, and keeps future full/no-cache policy refinement developer-approved.
The current implemented CI aggregate and full-hooks split runs main `CI` lesson aggregate and full/no-cache Git hook verification as separate jobs with a strict final gate; cache policy and full/no-cache semantics are unchanged.
The current implemented dashboard control center data layer provides a read-only JSON source behind an AI-driven development control center.
The current implemented dashboard control center React UI is documented as `dashboard_control_center_react_ui_plan`; it provides a read-only browser control-center scope with maintained entry tooling, standalone/aggregate browser checks, and no UI action execution.
The current implemented dashboard control center information architecture is documented as `dashboard_control_center_information_architecture`; it organizes the browser dashboard into categories, added the initial `en`/`ja` fixed-label localization, shows snapshot freshness, and keeps command previews isolated under Safety Actions. Full standard Dashboard UI locale support is implemented separately as `dashboard_control_center_full_locale_ui_support`.
The current implemented dashboard control center visual polish is documented as `dashboard_control_center_visual_polish`; it aligns the categorized read-only dashboard more closely with the generated mock while preserving safety and data boundaries.
The current implemented dashboard control center mock parity is documented as `dashboard_control_center_mock_parity`; it adds producer-owned metrics, a structured primary action, compact issue previews, central percentage rings, and Explore Pages metrics without fixed mock values.
The latest implemented dashboard control center live snapshot sync is documented as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`; it adds atomic validated snapshot publication and read-only browser polling with last-known-good behavior while preserving the no browser command execution boundary.
The current implemented dashboard control center mock-aligned Overview is documented as `dashboard_control_center_mock_aligned_overview`; it makes the Overview more closely match the mock while keeping Partial Failures stable, manual follow-ups separate, and the browser read-only.
The current implemented dashboard control center detail-page mock parity follow-up is documented as `dashboard_control_center_detail_mock_parity`; it aligns the four category detail pages with the approved detail mock images as UI/UX source references and makes each page explain what it checks, what judgment it supports, and what must be reviewed next.
The current implemented dashboard control center Settings safe change is documented as `dashboard_control_center_settings_safe_change_plan`; it provides guarded Settings edits, immediate post-apply snapshot refresh, and workflow display language control for Dashboard fixed UI labels without a page reload.
Safe product repository cleanup remains implemented for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
It also preserves the 7-day and 14-day learning-mode, workflow display language, product development language, and expanded language-list controls.
The shared standard language list remains `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`, while `zh` remains a `zh-CN` alias and `custom` remains available.
The implementation remains additive and keeps the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, free-development flow, advanced modules, existing checks, and repository-boundary behavior intact.

## Implemented Test And CI Final Gate Optimization Work

Status: implemented; local verification passed, and remote `CI` / `Lesson14 CI` remain the external completion gates for the pushed commit.
This implementation completes the test and CI runtime optimization work.
It targets the current `aggregate-and-full-hooks` bottleneck while preserving existing CI, pre-commit, full/no-cache safety, 7-day lesson behavior, 14-day lesson behavior, security checks, product-security checks, and as-built synchronization.

- [x] Add Playwright evidence generation and reuse so final aggregation does not rerun Playwright when same-run evidence is valid.
- [x] Add a hook-specific gap-only final gate so full hooks do not rerun `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` after equivalent hook coverage has already run.
- [x] Add `docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_COVERAGE.tsv` so aggregate requirements must be covered by hook evidence or explicit final-gap commands.
- [x] Keep `test_lesson_start_position` and `test_lesson14` covered by dedicated full/fast hook rows before the final gate.
- [x] Split `Lesson14 CI` to use a Lesson14-specific final gate instead of duplicating the common aggregate/full-hooks final gate.
- [x] Preserve the legacy `Lesson14 CI` `playwright-tests` and `aggregate-and-full-hooks` job contexts as lightweight compatibility gates.
- [x] Add a mechanical final-gate test proving missing or stale same-run evidence fails closed and valid evidence runs only final-gap commands.
- [x] Reduce duplicate common final-gate work between `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` internally while preserving required workflow names.
- [x] Extend full/no-cache recommendation paths for final-gate coverage, final-gate commands, CI evidence, and as-built evidence implementation changes.
- [x] Add GitHub Actions npm dependency caching.

- [x] Pass local verification, remote `CI`, and remote `Lesson14 CI` after implementation.

## CI Timing And Approved Auto-Improvement Work

Status: implemented.
This cycle adds measured final common aggregate/full-hooks timing and proposal-only recommendations before any full/no-cache behavior changes.
It preserves the current final-gate behavior and leaves generated improvements approval-gated.

- [x] Synchronize the plan into the three as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
- [x] Add machine-readable timing report support for final common aggregate/full-hooks checks through `tools/ci-timing`.
- [x] Store timing reports as CI artifacts without secrets or raw environment data.

- [x] Add `test_ci_timing` as a standalone and aggregate-callable regression test.
- [x] Keep conditional `full no-cache` scope reduction as a later approval-gated step.
- [x] Require developer approval before implementing any generated improvement candidate or changing final-gate/full-no-cache behavior.

## CI Aggregate And Full-Hooks Split Work

Status: implemented; local verification, sub-agent review, commit, push, required remote `CI` and `Lesson14 CI`, and local/remote sync passed.
This cycle implements only the approved first timing-based acceleration candidate: split the main `CI` final common verification job into parallel lesson aggregate and full Git hook jobs with a strict final gate.
Cache policy changes are out of scope for this cycle.

- [x] Confirm scope: no persistent verification-result cache, no conditional full/no-cache skipping, no changed-only authoritative CI, no Git hook group matrix split, and no flaky quarantine.
- [x] Preserve existing Step 1-7, Step 1-14, applied lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, Security guard, product-security, docs-tour, as-built sync, pre-commit, local full/no-cache, and remote CI behavior.
- [x] Add `ci_aggregate_full_hooks_split` to the as-built sync contract as `implemented`.
- [x] Split main `CI` into `lesson-aggregate`, `git-hooks-full-no-cache`, and `final-gate`.
- [x] Keep `Lesson14 CI` compatibility contexts unchanged.
- [x] Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh --use-evidence --write-evidence` and `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache --jobs 4` as the authoritative heavy checks.
- [x] Require `final-gate` to always start, validate split prerequisite results, consume same-run Git hook evidence, and fail closed when evidence is missing or mismatched.
- [x] Avoid timing artifact filename collisions by writing split timing reports to distinct files.
- [x] Prevent split-job `CI_TIMING_REPORT` paths from leaking into nested timing self-tests.
- [x] Keep same-run evidence filenames safe for GitHub artifact upload while preserving original evidence ids in metadata.
- [x] Use a stable Lesson14 compatibility marker instead of a free-form prose dependency.
- [x] Update `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh` for the split job graph, evidence handoff, and timing artifact merge.
- [x] Update `tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh` so the split remains standalone and aggregate-callable.
- [x] Run synchronization, structure, focused CI, aggregate, full/no-cache, and pre-commit verification after artifact-safety fixes.
- [x] Complete sub-agent review and resolve findings after artifact-safety fixes.
- [x] Commit, push, confirm required remote `CI` and `Lesson14 CI`, and verify local/remote sync.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Data Layer Work

Status: implemented.
The runtime implementation provides a read-only data layer before any React/Vite or browser UI work.
The implementation keeps the existing `tools/dashboard` CLI as a human-readable compatibility surface and adds a stable JSON source for an AI-driven development control center.
Future React/Vite mechanics must remain hidden behind the dashboard control-center surface so ordinary users do not need to see Vite commands, dev-server URLs, package scripts, or frontend internals.
The intended future user path is one action: open the dashboard/control center through the provided entry point while maintained tooling handles setup, Vite startup, URL selection, JSON loading, and checks.
The intended future UI is dual-audience: non-engineers should see lesson content/progress/management clearly, and intermediate or senior engineers should see practical workflow content/progress/management, gate, evidence, blocker, approval, and next-action state without losing operational detail.
The dashboard must preserve the repository's two first-class surfaces, lessons and workflows, as separate but coordinated control-panel areas.

- [x] Add `docs/workflow/DASHBOARD_DATA_SCHEMA.tsv` as the implemented source for field paths, source groups, state vocabulary, and safety requirements.
- [x] Add `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh` as a standalone and aggregate-callable schema drift guard.
- [x] Add reusable dashboard-data helpers under `tools/lib/`.
- [x] Add `tools/dashboard-data` as a read-only JSON producer.
- [x] Add concise lesson/workflow guidance items to the read-only dashboard summary contract.
- [x] Represent all-steps-completed lesson state as `passed` instead of `unknown`.
- [x] Add `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh` as a standalone-callable and aggregate-callable focused test.
- [x] Wire the focused test into aggregate validation, Git hooks, pre-commit, CI, and the sync contract after runtime artifacts exist.
- [x] Add `dashboard_control_center_data_layer` to the as-built sync contract as `implemented`.
- [x] Synchronize the implemented work across the three as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
- [ ] Add a React/Vite read-only UI only after the JSON schema and tests are stable and approved.
- [ ] When the React/Vite UI is approved, expose it through the dashboard control center rather than through Vite-specific learner-facing workflow.
- [ ] Keep the future non-engineer workflow to a single dashboard/control-center entry action.
- [ ] Keep workflow status practical for intermediate and senior engineers; do not collapse gates, evidence, blockers, approvals, and next operational actions into vague learner-only labels.
- [ ] Keep lesson status and workflow status visually and structurally distinct in future control-panel navigation and grouping.

Implemented constraints:

- Do not parse `tools/dashboard` prose in a browser.
- Do not make the dashboard a new source of truth.
- Do not expose Vite startup, dev-server URLs, package scripts, or frontend internals as the ordinary dashboard workflow.
- Do not require ordinary users to run multiple setup, server, URL, data, or verification commands to access the control center.
- Do not make workflow management so simplified that engineers lose gate, evidence, blocker, approval, or next-action detail needed for real work.
- Do not hard-code UI-only hints; keep concise guidance available through the dashboard data contract.
- Do not merge lesson progress and workflow progress into an ambiguous single status surface.
- Do not run push, PR creation, merge, cleanup, deletion, OAuth/API, external integration, or other dangerous actions from the initial dashboard.
- Do not mix `policy ready`, `settings ready`, `gate passed`, `approval required`, `optional`, `cached`, or `unknown` state.
- Do not add fixed product-stack branches or current-wording-only checks.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center React UI Work

Status: implemented.
This work implements the dashboard/control-center React UI after the planned sync and developer approval for React/Vite dependencies, package scripts, runtime files, maintained entry tooling, and browser test wiring.
It is additive and does not replace `tools/dashboard`, parse `tools/dashboard` prose, move owner-layer checks into React, make frontend state authoritative, or execute commands from the UI.

- [x] Organize the implementation proposal around purpose, problems, scope, non-scope, existing-feature impact, document updates, tests, and risks.
- [x] Define the implementation plan around change targets, order, document synchronization, verification, recovery, and developer approval gates.
- [x] Keep `dashboard_control_center_data_layer` as the implemented JSON source and maintain a separate sync ID for the React UI phase.
- [x] Require one ordinary user entry action for the future control center, with Vite mechanics hidden by maintained tooling.
- [x] Require lesson and workflow surfaces to remain separate and practical for both non-engineer users and engineers.
- [x] Keep the initial future UI read-only and command-preview-only.
- [x] Extend the dashboard JSON contract before rendering lesson points, warnings, or next actions as structured fields.
- [x] Obtain developer approval before adding React/Vite dependencies, package scripts, dev-server wrappers, browser runtime files, or browser test wiring.
- [x] Implement the UI after planned sync and local checks, with sub-agent review findings resolved before final PASS.
- [x] Add standalone-callable and aggregate-callable UI tests after runtime artifacts exist.
- [ ] Keep future action execution, live authoritative network/GitHub status, and existing `tools/dashboard` semantic changes behind separate developer approval.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Information Architecture Work

Status: implemented.
This work implements the wall-bounced dashboard UI direction as a categorized read-only control-center improvement.
It follows the generated mock's information architecture while preserving the dashboard JSON data source, CLI dashboard, existing lessons, checks, CI, pre-commit, and no-UI-execution boundary.

- [x] Organize the implementation proposal around purpose, solved problems, target scope, non-scope, existing-feature impact, required document updates, required tests, and risks.
- [x] Present and implement the plan around changed files, implementation order, document synchronization, verification, failure recovery, and approval boundaries.
- [x] Add category navigation for Overview, Lessons, Development Workflow, Maintenance Sync, and Safety Actions.
- [x] Make Overview the default first screen with snapshot status, generated time, relative age, read-only state, blockers, next safe action, and category health.
- [x] Keep command previews out of Overview and show them only under Safety Actions as preview-only, non-executable data.
- [x] Add fixed-label localization for `en` and `ja` using device language with English fallback.
- [x] Keep commands, file paths, gate IDs, source names, and dashboard JSON prose unmodified by browser-side translation.
- [x] Preserve secret-like redaction, absolute-path normalization, no-button command execution, and mobile layout constraints.
- [x] Extend Playwright coverage for category navigation, localization, Safety Actions isolation, redaction, and responsive layout.
- [x] Keep automatic updates out of this information-architecture layer; live read-only snapshot refresh is implemented later as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`.
- [ ] Keep UI command execution, live authoritative CI/Git status, and broad localization for separately approved future phases.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Visual Polish Work

Status: implemented.
This work brings the categorized dashboard closer to `dashboard-control-center/mocks/archive/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` as a visual polish layer only.
It does not change command execution, live status authority, dashboard data ownership, existing CLI dashboard behavior, or existing lesson/check/CI behavior.

- [x] Organize the implementation proposal around purpose, problems, scope, non-scope, existing-feature impact, document updates, tests, and risks.
- [x] Define the implementation plan around file targets, implementation order, document synchronization, verification, recovery, and approval gates.
- [x] Keep visual polish separate from `dashboard_control_center_data_layer`, `dashboard_control_center_react_ui_plan`, and `dashboard_control_center_information_architecture`.
- [x] Make the top snapshot status closer to the mock's segmented operational strip.
- [x] Move desktop Overview health cards toward a compact 2x2 layout.
- [x] Add Explore Pages-style category shortcuts without creating command execution affordances.
- [x] Add sidebar read-only and last-updated context.
- [x] Preserve `en`/`ja` fixed-label behavior and data-text non-translation.
- [x] Extend Playwright checks for visual structure without pixel-perfect screenshot matching.
- [x] Keep automatic refresh out of this visual-polish layer; live read-only snapshot refresh is implemented later as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`.
- [ ] Keep live CI/Git authority, UI-triggered checks, command execution, new dependencies, and broad localization for later separately approved phases.

## Implemented Documentation Map Synchronization

The lesson now explains the repository's rule, routing, skill, design, workflow, and memory documents in a way that non-engineer learners can understand.
Runtime implementation is complete and the docs map artifacts are present.

- Added `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills as the agent-facing rule and navigation layer.
- Distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD`, legacy product-side `AGENT.md`, and the planned product-side `AGENTS.MD` transition.
- Explain `docs/as-built/` as the requirements, specification, and implementation-plan area.
- Explain `docs/workflow/` as the task-tracker and handoff area.
- Explain `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, and `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv` as Git hook policy and current local hook-mode controls.
- Explain `docs/memory/` as memory and decision records, including `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Explain `docs/memory/SESSION_MEMORY.md` and product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records without claiming a lesson-side failure-memory file exists.
- Added `tools/docs-tour` with `status`, `rules`, `design`, `workflow`, `memory`, `skills`, and `all` views.
- Made `tools/docs-tour` adapt to learning modes A/B/C.
- Added `./tools/dashboard docs` and included that view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Added copy-paste prompt examples for asking an agent to explain `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` and the as-built trio in learner-friendly language.
- Added early 7-day and 14-day guidance so learners understand why the documents exist before they use them deeply.
- Added `tools/check_document_root.sh` and wired it through `tools/check_agents_skills.sh` so `docs/**/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and skill `references/*.md` cannot lose their `AGENTS.MD`-rooted route silently.
- Added `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and wired it into structure/as-built/developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, skills, memory workflow, and repository-boundary behavior.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/check_document_root.sh`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/check_document_root.sh`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- The validation suite must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Product Repository Cleanup Synchronization

The lesson now provides a safe, explicit cleanup path for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `tools/product-repository-cleanup`.
- Support `status`, `plan`, `local`, and `remote` subcommands.
- Keep `status` and `plan` non-destructive.
- Require explicit confirmation for local cleanup with the configured product repository name, such as `task-tracker-repository`.
- Require explicit confirmation for remote cleanup with the full GitHub owner/repository name, such as `xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository`.
- Keep local deletion and remote deletion separate; do not add `all` or automatic chained deletion.
- Reject local deletion unless the target is the configured external product repository path, normally `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository`.
- Reject local deletion when the target is inside the lesson repository, does not match the configured product repository name, is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, is not the Git top level, or cannot be identified safely.
- Require GitHub authentication and a successful remote repository lookup before any remote deletion attempt.
- Show the remote URL and owner/repository name before any remote deletion.
- Print a clear operation log for status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths.
- Added `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
- Test status, plan, missing confirmation, wrong confirmation, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- Do not delete a real GitHub repository in lesson-repository tests.
- Wired the cleanup test into structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Exposed runtime discovery through README, AGENTS routing, menu item 5, and the dashboard development view.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented As-Built Sync Contract Synchronization

The lesson now strengthens mechanical enforcement across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` as the contract source for synchronized improvement IDs.
- Record each synchronized improvement with `sync_id`, `status`, `title`, `required_artifacts`, `required_tests`, `required_docs`, and `runtime_evidence`.
- Added matching `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks to all five synchronized documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
- Added `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Fail when a contract sync ID is missing from any of the five documents.
- Fail when any of the five documents contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- Fail when the same sync ID is marked `planned` in one document and `implemented` in another.
- Fail when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- Fail when required artifacts or required tests are missing from the repository.
- Fail when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- Fail when an implemented sync ID's required tests are not actively wired into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Keep `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh` and its topic-based checks active.
- Call `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` from `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Keep `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` active for the `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` pair.
- Added `tools/as-built-sync status` to show sync IDs, document coverage, artifact presence, and test wiring.
- Added `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Test complete synchronization, missing document block, unknown sync ID, mixed status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifact, inert wiring, and missing active test-wiring failure paths.
- Added `AGENTS.MD` routing and standard-check references for sync-contract status and validation.
- Wired the validator and regression test into `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, docs-tour, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Learner Context Foundation Synchronization

The lesson now has an implemented learner-context foundation and read-only validation path.

- Added `learning/context/README.md`.
- Added `learning/context/AI_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT_FOUNDATION.md`.
- Added `learning/context/SECURITY_FOUNDATION.md`.
- Added `learning/context/LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`.
- Added `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`, `tools/lesson-context`, and `tools/test_lesson_context.sh`.
- Updated structure checks, Git hooks, final-gate coverage, Test Plan Manifest, CI, and Lesson14 CI syntax coverage.
- Promoted `learner_context_foundation` in `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` to `STATUS: implemented`.
- Added matching implemented sync blocks to the three as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
- Preserved existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, docs-tour, product-repository cleanup, sync-contract, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Learner Context Runtime Integration Synchronization

The implementation connects learner context to runtime output while preserving the distinction between lessons and workflows.

- Learning context targets are 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, and applied lesson.
- Workflow context targets are Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson repository maintenance.
- Free Development Mode remains a workflow that applies the learned AI-driven development process to user-selected products.
- Runtime artifacts include `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`, `tools/lesson-context`, `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`, and `tools/test_lesson_context.sh`.
- Runtime integration points include `tools/lesson`, `tools/lesson14`, and the shared `tools/lib/lesson_runtime.sh` status path.
- Tests run standalone and through aggregate checks, CI, Git hooks, and pre-commit.

## Implemented Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The Git workflow policy lets users choose how much Git management and Git automation the workflow agent may perform.
This is implemented runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Added `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` for supported Git workflow policy definitions.
- Added `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` for the current user-selected Git workflow settings.
- Added `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for shared setting loading, validation, permission checks, automation-level helpers, repository-context detection, and Git monitoring.
- Added `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the learner/agent command surface.
- Support working-branch permission, `git worktree` permission, and main-direct-work permission.
- Support automation levels:
  - `manual`: guidance only.
  - `commit`: commit may be automated after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks may be automated.
  - `sync`: main CI plus local/remote synchronization checks may be automated.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Monitor uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local/remote divergence, unnecessary working branches, unnecessary worktrees, and whether the current repository is the lesson, product, or a custom repository.
- Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.
- Keep cleanup planning non-destructive.
- Reuse existing repository-boundary, Git sync, menu prerequisite, dashboard, and aggregate-test patterns.
- Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` for settings validation, permission decisions, automation-level decisions, dirty-state detection, local/remote sync monitoring, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- Wired validation into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.

## Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The implemented improvement promotes Git workflow policy from an independent support setting to a shared menu-level policy.
This is runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the existing policy source.
- Make menu categories reference the same Git policy:
  - learning paths: 7-day, 14-day, and applied lesson,
  - building/extending paths: Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, and External Integration,
  - maintenance path: lesson repository improvement.
- Show Git policy readiness in `tools/menu readiness` for menu items 1 through 7.
- Added Git policy validation to `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` without weakening existing menu prerequisites.
- Added `tools/menu check 7` and `tools/menu start 7 --confirm` as a safe lesson-maintenance path.
- Keep `automation_level=manual` valid and non-blocking.
- Interpret automation levels consistently as guidance-only, commit, PR/CI, and sync scopes.
- Keep destructive Git operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Show menu-wide Git policy status in dashboard output.
- Added tests for valid policy readiness, invalid policy values, item 1 through 7 checks, missing policy files, and no-tradeoff behavior.

## Implemented Git Workflow Action Settings Synchronization

The implemented improvement splits Git workflow automation into action-by-action manual or automatic settings.
It remains additive and must not trade away existing Git policy, menu, dashboard, cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep existing settings:
  - `branch_allowed`
  - `worktree_allowed`
  - `main_direct_work_allowed`
  - `automation_level`
- Treat `automation_level` as a compatibility preset.
- Detailed settings take precedence only when the detailed setting key is present.
- Fall back to `automation_level` when a detailed setting key is absent so current implemented behavior is preserved.
- Add detailed settings:
  - `commit_automation: manual|auto`
  - `push_automation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_creation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `merge_execution: manual|after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false|true`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: manual|auto`
- Implemented defaults:
  - `commit_automation: auto`
  - `push_automation: manual`
  - `pr_creation: manual`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `merge_execution: after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: auto`
- These detailed defaults are active after implementation; `automation_level` remains available as a compatibility preset when detailed action keys are absent.
- Add shared action-mode resolution in `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for `commit`, `push`, `pr`, `ci`, `pr_ci`, `merge`, `main_ci`, and `sync`.
- Keep `ci` as a compatibility alias for CI monitoring so existing `tools/git-workflow allow ci` behavior is preserved.
- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set` as the setting surface.
- Show detailed settings in `tools/menu readiness` and `tools/dashboard menu`.
- Apply the settings to menu items 1 through 7.
- For push and PR creation, `auto` means the agent may execute the operation only after explicit approval for that operation is recorded; it never means approval-free execution.
- `merge_execution: after_approval` means the agent may execute merge only after explicit merge approval is recorded.
- `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_APPROVALS.tsv` stores matching action, repository, and branch approval receipts for detailed push, PR creation, and normal merge execution.
- `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` is the only implemented path for developer-responsibility approval-free merge and requires PR CI success, clear target PR and branch, verified merge base, clean working tree, checked local/remote state, and stop-on-failure behavior.
- Developer-responsibility auto-merge requires gate evidence plus actual repository checks; the setting alone does not permit approval-free merge.
- Keep branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository deletion behind explicit user confirmation regardless of merge settings.
- Add tests for defaults, valid changes, invalid values, detailed-setting precedence, menu display, dashboard display, and preservation of existing workflows.

## Implemented Git Hooks Policy Synchronization

The implemented improvement provides the runtime path for faster pre-commit execution.
It is synchronized as `git_hooks_policy` with `STATUS: implemented`.

- Keep the current pre-commit behavior as the safety baseline.
- Keep hooks serial and avoid a normal learner-facing `off` mode.
- Add implemented modes:
  - `full`: current-equivalent required pre-commit coverage.
  - `fast`: conservative cache-assisted execution that skips only checks with unchanged successful inputs.
  - `minimal`: quick local mechanical feedback that is not enough for final completion by itself.
- Store cache data outside version control under a Git-local cache path such as `.git/pre-commit-cache/`.
- Fail closed on missing, stale, corrupted, or unverifiable cache entries.
- Fail closed on malformed `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` rows, including invalid or empty mode tokens.
- Store the hook check list in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`.
- Store the local full/no-cache recommendation path policy in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`.
- Provide a reusable command surface for hook status, mode selection, cache clearing, normal run, no-cache run, and explicit mode run.
- Provide a reusable recommendation surface so local full/no-cache is recommended for Git hooks, CI, checks, tests, or as-built synchronization changes, while ordinary local work can stay on the selected mode such as `minimal`.
- Connect the implementation to existing settings files, `tools/lib` helpers, aggregate tests, CI, pre-commit, and repo-local skills.
- Preserve existing wiring enforcement by teaching the existing checks and status output to recognize runner-based pre-commit dispatch.
- Keep CI and completion verification on full or no-cache execution.
- Add `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` for standalone policy/cache validation, invalid persisted settings, malformed check rows, invalid or empty mode tokens, invalidation, no-cache behavior, minimal-mode coverage, failing-check cache refusal, and safe cache clearing.
- Extend `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` for local verification recommendation behavior.
- Verify full/no-cache coverage, aggregate wiring, CI wiring, and preservation of existing checks through `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and the CI workflow definitions.
- Require developer approval before changing the minimal-mode required check list or using cache to skip Playwright-related checks beyond the implemented fail-closed behavior.

## Implemented Local Verification Scope Policy

Status: implemented; this is a documentation and contract synchronization update over existing verification policy artifacts.

- [x] Add the AGENTS invariant after existing rules without changing existing rule text.
- [x] Record that this everyday rule is below the no-existing-feature-tradeoff invariant.
- [x] Preserve `TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv` as the changed-path required-check source.
- [x] Preserve `GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` as the runnable check catalog.
- [x] Preserve `GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` as recommendation policy, not automatic agent permission.
- [x] Keep lightweight UI, wording, CSS, and layout changes scoped to contract-relevant verification unless risk expands.
- [x] Keep contract, schema, shared-tooling, Git hooks, CI, test-infrastructure, and broad implementation changes on the broader contract-required verification path.
- [x] Keep developer-memory documentation out of scope.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Control

Shared menu prerequisite control is implemented without replacing existing lesson or product workflows.

- Rename the learner-facing menu item to `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the Team Development and Docker path available through the renamed applied-learning item.
- Require learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context/boundary confirmation where relevant, and learner approval before starting menu items 1 through 6.
- Reuse existing 7-day and 14-day settings where available.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the most recently configured structured-lesson settings when possible; otherwise require missing settings before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for product-side work.
- Implement the prerequisite logic through shared reusable helpers rather than duplicated menu branches.
- Keep `status` commands non-blocking for discovery; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Add a mechanically checkable product-improvement entry point for menu item 5.
- Expand dashboard readiness output for menu items 1 through 6.
- Add tests for the renamed menu label, absence of the old learner-facing label, missing-prerequisite failure paths, unchanged existing 7-day/14-day behavior, and preservation of existing Free Development, Team Development, external-integration, dashboard, and product-gate checks.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Mock Parity

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_mock_parity`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Implemented work:

- Keep the implemented data layer, React/Vite UI, categorized information architecture, and visual-polish layers intact.
- Add producer-owned category metrics so health-card percentages and Explore Pages counts are not invented by the browser.
- Add a structured primary action so the Overview can show the mock-level Review lessons and accept for workflow intent compactly.
- Keep Next Safe Action compact and keep full issue details reachable through the relevant category pages.
- Show Partial Failures as a compact preview when real failed, blocked, or unknown items exist.
- Keep optional or unverified checks separate from true failures.
- Render health rings with central percentage values and Explore Pages cards with bottom metrics.
- Use at least two valid fixtures with different metrics so fixed mock percentages and counts fail.
- Allow read-only navigation and summary controls while rejecting command-execution controls.
- Preserve read-only behavior, Safety Actions isolation, localization boundaries, and existing 7-day/14-day/CI/document routes.

Implemented verification entry points:

- `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh`.
- `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh`.
- `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Full/no-cache Git hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`, and `tools/ci-final-gate` are final verification evidence outside the sync-contract `TESTS` field.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Live Snapshot Sync

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Implemented work:

- Keep browser behavior read-only and GET-only for dashboard JSON.
- Use producer-owned `snapshot_id` and `content_hash` for snapshot change detection.
- Publish snapshots atomically through `tools/dashboard-control-center`.
- Refresh the JSON snapshot while the control-center dev server is open.
- Poll the dashboard JSON from React and update changed data without a page reload.
- Keep the last known good snapshot visible on invalid JSON, failed refresh, or schema violation.
- Show stale or refresh-error display state without treating it as CI, Git, security, or approval authority.
- Add deterministic Playwright coverage for live update and failed refresh behavior.
- Add static checks that reject browser command execution paths and non-GET dashboard-data fetches.

Implemented verification entry points:

- `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh`.
- `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh`.
- `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Mock-Aligned Overview

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_mock_aligned_overview`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Implemented work:

- Remove visible main header chrome and the visible snapshot explanation from the Overview while preserving an accessible page title.
- Restyle Next Safe Action as the dominant mock-aligned safe-action card.
- Keep the Next Safe Action label/helper outside the green primary action row and keep target, expected result, and risk as white icon-led metadata rows.
- Keep Partial Failures visible as a stable summary category and show a concise none state when there are no true failures.
- Move manual follow-ups out of the Partial Failures level and into a separate third-row summary with detail navigation.
- Remove the visible Category Health heading while keeping the accessible category-health region.
- Align the four health-card heights inside the grid.
- Avoid Overview disclosure expansion that changes the control-panel layout.
- Add mock-aligned decorative left icons to navigation, status, repeated cards, summaries, detail rows, and command previews for scanning.
- Use four distinct health-ring category colors for lessons, workflow, maintenance, and safety.
- Add a concise repository-control-panel read-only notice at the bottom.
- Preserve live snapshot sync, last-known-good behavior, Safety Actions isolation, and existing category navigation.

Implemented verification entry points:

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Detail-Page Mock Parity

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_detail_mock_parity`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Implemented work:

- Used `dashboard-control-center/mocks/archive/mock-detail-lessons.png`, `mock-detail-workflow.png`, `mock-detail-maintenance.png`, and `mock-detail-safety.png` as the UI/UX source references for detail-page hierarchy, density, color direction, and icon direction.
- Added shared detail page headers and decision summaries to Lessons, Development Workflow, Maintenance Sync, and Safety Actions.
- Make each detail page state what it checks, current judgment, must-review items, and the next safe check.
- Replaced workflow category icons across Overview, navigation, Explore Pages, and detail pages with one centralized branching workflow icon component.
- Centered short localized risk/status labels such as `低`.
- Reworked Lessons into mock-aligned inspection panels where missing settings, warnings, and next learning action are visible before calm completed details.
- Reworked Development Workflow so approval-required and unknown items are prioritized in checklist rows and technical keys become secondary metadata.
- Reworked Maintenance Sync so snapshot trust, manual follow-ups, warnings, and source boundaries read as one confirmation flow.
- Reworked Safety Actions so Partial Failures, approval state, and display-only Command Previews are visually distinct and non-executable.
- Kept English as the repository-standard data language while displaying fixed UI labels and known control-center source/intent labels through the resolved UI locale.
- Kept lesson/workflow language settings separate from the control-panel UI locale resolver.
- Preserve live snapshot sync, last-known-good behavior, Safety Actions isolation, existing category navigation, and all 7-day/14-day flows.
- Follow-up tightening keeps the approved mock images as the UI/UX source references and refines page-specific header icons, first-row decision-summary bullets and badges, active sidebar category context, workflow icon glyph consistency, maintenance/safety icon containers, failure severity glyphs, and compact read-only command preview grouping.
- The follow-up does not change the dashboard data schema, producer ownership, live snapshot sync, command-preview safety boundary, UI-locale resolver, 7-day flow, 14-day flow, CI policy, or pre-commit policy.

Planned verification entry points:

- `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- `tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh`.

Real product operations testing remains available through `tools/test_production_operations.sh` when an external product repository is intentionally recreated.

## Remaining Work

- Implemented sync ID `lesson_display_label_policy` for the STEP display-label cleanup.
  The issue is not a global text replacement: learner-facing labels, `Step N/14` sync-gate keys, internal compatibility names, and historical records must be separated before implementation.
  Added `docs/workflow/LESSON_DISPLAY_LABELS.tsv` and `tools/lib/lesson_display_labels.sh` so menu, dashboard, roadmap, lesson14 reset/runtime, learning-record, and helpdesk output use shared STEP display labels.
  Updated learner-facing menu, dashboard, roadmap, lesson14 reset/runtime output, learn/helpdesk record labels, README, AGENTS routing text, index files, guides, prompts, playbooks, and scenario text while preserving `Step N/14` sync gates, internal aliases, and historical learning records.
  Expanded `tools/check_learner_display.sh` and `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` so active learner-facing old duration labels fail while internal compatibility names remain valid.

TESTS: tools/check_learner_display.sh,tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh,tools/check_lesson14_sync.sh,tools/check_agents_skills.sh,tools/test_lesson14.sh

- For `test_ci_final_gate_optimization_plan`, commit and push only after local checks pass; final reporting remains gated on remote `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` for the pushed commit.
- For future test/CI acceleration work after `test_ci_full_pipeline_acceleration_plan`, start from a clean Git state, preserve required workflow names, and keep new plans non-authoritative until runtime changes and tests are complete.
- Translate remaining learner-facing Markdown files to English using the audit output from `tools/list_non_english_docs.sh`.

Sync ID: `step_1_14_product_launch_quality_gate`.
Current status: `implemented`.
Priority: 1.

Implemented task state:

- [x] Identify the user-facing launch-path failure: README direct `index.html` opening can diverge from HTTP-only E2E coverage.
- [x] Record that the STEP 1-14 task-tracker product should keep direct `index.html` launch unless an approved specification changes it.
- [x] Add launch-path gate coverage to STEP 1-14 completion.
- [x] Add `tools/product-launch-check` and `tools/test_product_launch_check.sh`, then update sync contract artifacts/tests after those runtime artifacts exist.
- [x] Ensure the Add Task workflow is checked through the documented user launch path.
- [x] Prevent final STEP 1-14 completion when README launch instructions and tested launch path disagree.
- [x] Update generated product guidance so README, product docs, product tracker, and product handoff describe the same launch and verification path.
- [x] Keep launch verification standalone-runnable and aggregate-runnable.
- [x] Move the sync ID to implemented only after runtime artifacts and required verification pass.

Constraints:

- Preserve existing STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14 ordered progression, approvals, CI, checks, document routes, and repository-boundary behavior.
- Do not change the official launch path to HTTP-server-only without developer approval.

- [x] Keep evidence regression fixtures temporary inside tests unless persistent fixture files are added to sync contract artifacts.
- [x] Ensure multiple applicable evidence rows emit valid JSON.
- [x] Promote required `failed`, `blocked`, `unknown`, `stale`, and `not_run` evidence to product-operation blocker or manual-required state.
- [x] Keep optional evidence visible without treating it as required.
- [x] Preserve dashboard-data as a read-only consumer of product authority state.
- [x] Move the sync ID to implemented only after targeted product authority and dashboard-data verification pass.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Selected Context Sync Work

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_selected_context_sync`.
Current status: `implemented`.
Priority: 4.

Implemented task state:

- [x] Record the implementation proposal and implementation plan in developer memory.
- [x] Review the plan with multiple sub-agent perspectives before document synchronization.
- [x] Synchronize the planned work into the five synchronized documents and sync contract.
- [x] Add `selected_context` and `available_contexts` to the dashboard data schema.
- [x] Implement producer-side selected-context resolution from existing lesson, workflow, product, Git, CI, Security, and evidence sources.
- [x] Keep selected-context status readers as read-only evidence/settings readers rather than command executors.
- [x] Remove fixed `product-improvement` and single product repository assumptions from dashboard-data.
- [x] Consume product authority evidence status from `product_authority_evidence_status_propagation` rather than duplicating aggregation in dashboard code.
- [x] Consume scaffold and canonical resolver behavior from `free_development_product_repo_scaffold`; root fallback is superseded by `product_repository_canonical_docs_only`.
- [x] Update dashboard-data to render context/evidence-driven Git, CI, Security, blockers, manual follow-ups, and command previews without running checks.
- [x] Update the React control center to display selected-context selector, current-state summaries, Git/Security cross-cutting status, and selected-context detail-page foundations.
- [x] Extend fixtures and targeted tests for selected context, evidence aggregation, canonical docs behavior, read-only UI behavior, and Partial Failures/manual follow-up separation.
- [x] Move the sync ID to implemented only after the planned runtime work and required verification pass.

Follow-up: full mock-source-of-truth visual parity for the five context pages is implemented by `dashboard_control_center_context_mock_source_of_truth`.

Current constraints:

- Preserve existing STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, existing CI, existing checks, existing documentation routes, Git hooks, pre-commit, live snapshot sync, and read-only dashboard boundaries.
- Keep dashboard-data as a read-only producer that reads existing data and evidence only.
- Do not add browser command execution, POST actions, live GitHub/CI authority, push, merge, cleanup, deletion, OAuth, tokens, or destructive operations.
- Keep implementation policy-driven through existing settings, manifests, shared libraries, and tests rather than product-stack-specific or wording-specific branches.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Context Mock Source Of Truth Work

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_context_mock_source_of_truth`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Implemented task state:

- [x] Confirm the approved source images: `mock-context-overview.png`, `mock-context-lessons.png`, `mock-context-workflow.png`, `mock-context-maintenance.png`, and `mock-context-safety.png`.
- [x] Record that current UI structure is still too close to the older generic categorized dashboard and must be re-centered on the five context mocks.
- [x] Record that existing selected-context and live snapshot producer work should be reused rather than replaced.
- [x] Synchronize the planned work into the five synchronized documents and sync contract.
- [x] Add schema-backed fields that are missing for mock parity, including current-step labels/totals, Git operation rows, maintenance evidence rows, Security approvals, dangerous-operation summaries, and command-preview grouping.
- [x] Extend `tools/dashboard-data` to emit those fields from existing settings, manifests, status, and evidence without executing commands.
- [x] Refactor the React shell, sidebar, Overview, Lessons, Workflow, Maintenance, and Safety pages to match the five mocks as the UI/UX source of truth.
- [x] Keep fixed labels in `i18n.js` and keep data-originated text as sanitized data.
- [x] Update fixtures and Playwright coverage for sidebar groups, seven menu tiles, context strip, Overview status cards, page-specific detail layouts, read-only boundaries, no command execution, and mobile no-overflow.
- [x] Move this sync ID to implemented only after runtime implementation and targeted checks pass.

Current constraints:

- Preserve STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, existing CI, existing checks, existing document routes, Git hooks, pre-commit, live snapshot sync, and dashboard read-only ownership.
- Keep dashboard-data and browser pages read-only.
- Do not add browser command execution, POST actions, live GitHub/CI authority, push, merge, cleanup, deletion, OAuth, tokens, evidence writing, or destructive operations.
- Do not hard-code one product stack, repository name, fixture value, Japanese phrase, screenshot number, or generated image pixel match.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Exact Mock Alignment Correction

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_mock_exact_alignment_correction`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Current task state:

- [x] Record the developer visual-review finding that the implemented mock-source dashboard remains insufficient for design, color, contrast, icon treatment, and content alignment.
- [x] Separate this corrective work from the earlier implemented mock-source sync IDs by creating a new planned sync ID.
- [x] Synchronize the implementation plan across requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, and the sync contract.
- [x] Implement producer-owned context-map, evidence, blocker, and metric corrections.
- [x] Expand `available_contexts[]` with a producer-owned context map so every displayed menu context has complete live-state data or an explicit incomplete state.
- [x] Implement exact mock-aligned page-specific UI surfaces for Overview, Lessons, Workflow, Maintenance, and Safety.
- [x] Propagate external product repository evidence into selected-context Git, CI, and Security status.
- [x] Require required evidence to be current and authoritative before it satisfies product authority readiness.
- [x] Replace fixed card explanations with producer-owned lesson settings, snapshot identity, maintenance evidence, security rows, and Partial Failure detail.
- [x] Strengthen external product repository scaffold and launch-quality wiring where the dashboard depends on those facts.
- [x] Clarify scaffold validation so `docs/memory/` is a standard directory while individual memory files remain optional until used.
- [x] Run runtime-targeted tests after implementation.
- [x] Replace the planned sync-contract `TESTS` list with runtime-required targeted checks before promoting this sync ID to `implemented`.
- [x] Promote this sync ID to `implemented` only after required runtime and synchronization checks pass.

Implementation work items:

1. Correct selected-context producer data so each displayed menu context has complete producer-owned state or a safe incomplete state.
2. Resolve STEP 1-14, Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson-repository improvement repositories through policy-backed context data.
3. Propagate product authority evidence states into blockers and manual-required states without UI-side status invention.
4. Derive selected-context Git, CI, and Security status from matching product authority evidence and blockers.
5. Keep required evidence non-healthy unless it is current and authoritative; repeated manifest evidence sources must not duplicate synthetic not-run blockers.
6. Rebuild the five dashboard pages around `mock-context-overview.png`, `mock-context-lessons.png`, `mock-context-workflow.png`, `mock-context-maintenance.png`, and `mock-context-safety.png`.
7. Keep Partial Failures always visible and limited to true current-context failed, blocked, or unknown conditions.
8. Keep command previews display-only and aligned with current settings and evidence.
9. Keep external product repositories canonical under `docs/product/`, `docs/workflow/`, `docs/memory/`, `ops/`, `src/`, and `tests/`, and block root duplicate Markdown documents.

Constraints:

- Existing STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, CI, checks, Git hooks, pre-commit, documentation routes, live snapshot sync, localization boundaries, and dashboard read-only behavior must remain intact.
- Do not add fixed screenshot values, fixed product names, one-language branches, one-stack assumptions, or browser-executed operations.
- Do not create repository information, documents, settings, help, or changelog pages until mock-backed requirements exist.

- [x] Record that `tools/dashboard-data` remains read-only and may only emit settings catalog data.
- [x] Implement `tools/dashboard-settings catalog|plan|apply --confirm` as the narrow repo-local update tool with allowlist validation, explicit confirmation, same-directory temporary writes, atomic rename, and snapshot regeneration.
- [x] Synchronize this implemented contract across the three as-built documents, this task tracker, handoff, and the sync contract.
- [x] Implement the settings catalog schema in `DASHBOARD_DATA_SCHEMA.tsv`.
- [x] Extend `tools/lib/dashboard_data.sh` and `tools/dashboard-data` to emit producer-owned settings groups and items.

- [x] Immediately refetch the regenerated dashboard snapshot after successful Settings apply so workflow display language changes update the UI without page reload.
- [x] Add Vite `/dashboard-settings/plan` and `/dashboard-settings/apply` middleware that accepts same-origin narrow JSON and calls `tools/dashboard-settings` through `execFile` without shell execution.
- [x] Keep product or work target naming display-only and route any future naming write path through product-profile policy and repository-boundary checks in a separate sync ID.
- [x] Add fixture and Playwright coverage for Settings responsive no-overflow, row rendering, related-page display, popup focus behavior, plan/apply payloads, approval-only rows, invalid catalog rejection, and missing catalog safe incomplete behavior.
- [x] Add Playwright coverage that changes `workflow_language` from Japanese to English and verifies fixed UI labels update without a reload marker being lost.

- [x] Exclude scope that would remove existing editable Settings behavior, add new writers, add new endpoints, weaken CI/pre-commit, or broaden mutation authority.
- [x] Synchronize the planned requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, and sync contract before runtime implementation.
- [x] Add independent Settings apply feedback state that separates writer success from snapshot reconciliation.
- [x] Add delayed non-modal progress feedback that appears only when reconciliation takes longer than the named UI-policy delay.
- [x] Confirm ordinary setting reflection from the Settings row in the refetched snapshot.
- [x] Confirm `workflow_language` reflection from summary locale fields, UI direction, and the Settings row.
- [x] Keep refetched snapshot data authoritative when apply metadata disagrees.
- [x] Remove `確認のみ` and `ここで変更可能` chips and move changeability to the right-end row action and accessible row label.
- [x] Make the Settings confirmation eyebrow slightly larger without changing the modal title hierarchy or compact layout.
- [x] Add all new fixed labels to the existing full-locale dictionary completeness path.
- [x] Extend Playwright and aggregate dashboard tests for fast path, delayed path, stale or mismatched snapshot, no reload, row labels, eyebrow sizing, RTL, and no-overflow.
- [x] Run synchronization, structure, and related dashboard verification before promoting this sync ID to implemented.
- [x] Complete implementation sub-agent verification with no unresolved major issues.

Active constraints:

- Existing STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, CI, checks, document routes, repo-local skills, Git hooks, pre-commit, Settings writer boundaries, Dashboard locale policy, and read-only pages outside Settings must remain intact.
- This implemented work does not add a new standalone checker; the reusable coverage remains `tools/test_dashboard_i18n.sh`, `tools/test_dashboard_settings.sh`, and `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
- Existing Settings editability is not reduced in this sync ID; proposals to make currently editable Git workflow settings display-only require separate developer approval.

Document synchronization verification state:

- [x] `npm run dashboard:build` passed after runtime changes.
- [x] `tools/test_dashboard_i18n.sh` passed after adding apply feedback locale keys.
- [x] `tools/test_dashboard_settings.sh` passed after runtime changes.
- [x] `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh` passed with 13 Playwright tests, including fast language switch, delayed feedback, stale snapshot authority, chip removal, action labels, eyebrow sizing, RTL, and no-overflow.
- [x] Structure, sync, test-plan, and workflow-pair checks passed after final implemented document promotion.
- [x] Sub-agent review finds no unresolved major issues.

Runtime implementation and sub-agent verification are complete for this sync ID.

Current task state:

- [x] Identify inconsistent Dashboard Settings combinations from developer review and read-only sub-agent audits.
- [x] Choose the additive sync ID `dashboard_control_center_settings_consistency_gate`.
- [x] Preserve existing Settings writer, locale, no-reload apply feedback, read-only dashboard pages, CI, hooks, and document routes as constraints.
- [x] Treat no-approved-write-path Git settings as a candidate validation error.
- [x] Treat branch-dependent automation with `branch_allowed=false` as a write-time error while allowing recovery from already persisted inconsistent states.
- [x] Keep current `automation_level` compatibility and merge precedence decisions approval-bound instead of silently changing behavior.
- [x] Require `merge_execution=manual` with `developer_auto_merge_allowed=true` to display as a qualified non-ready state unless a later approval changes runtime precedence.
- [x] Define context-dependent Settings rows so lesson-only, lesson-repository improvement, product-repository, and external-integration contexts cannot show misleading ready states.
- [x] Synchronize the requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, and sync contract.
- [x] Implement the shared owner-layer consistency gate in Git workflow policy, Settings writer, Dashboard data producer, browser validator, and Settings UI.
- [x] Extend runtime `tools/git-workflow allow` permission checks so persisted blocked Git workflow states cannot authorize an action.
- [x] Resolve the runtime blockers from earlier coverage: stale workflow-language labels and representative locale row overflow.
- [x] Complete synchronization, structure, and related Settings/Dashboard/Git workflow checks for this sync ID.
- [x] Complete multiple read-only xhigh sub-agent reviews with no unresolved major findings after owner-layer, UI/data/schema/i18n, and sync-contract fixes.

Current task state:

- [x] Identify the design issue: simple Free Development, Product Improvement, and External Integration work may not always need Git remote sync or CI.
- [x] Confirm that the existing implementation currently forces Git/CI through product gates and also has `.git` assumptions in repository boundary, product-security, product authority, and product-gate evidence.
- [x] Choose the additive direction: introduce product workflow Git usage modes separate from Git workflow action settings.
- [x] Preserve existing strict behavior by keeping `ci` as the default mode.
- [x] Record that `none` does not mean no checks; product workspace, documents, scaffold, security, external approval, and local checks remain required as applicable.
- [x] Keep `.git`-less authoritative evidence storage out of this implementation; Git/CI evidence is `not_applicable` when the selected mode does not use it, and future replacement evidence semantics remain approval-required.
- [x] Synchronize the implemented requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, and sync contract.

Implemented checklist:

- [x] Add owner-layer product workflow mode policy and setting storage.
- [x] Add shared helper resolution for `none`, `local`, `remote_sync`, and `ci`.
- [x] Route product-scoped menu gates through the shared helper.
- [x] Split product workspace and Git worktree requirements in boundary, scaffold, security, authority, and evidence paths.
- [x] Extend dashboard data/schema/browser validation with product workflow Git usage mode and applicability fields.
- [x] Add Settings edit support for the mode without broadening the existing Settings mutation boundary.
- [x] Update Workflow, Overview, command previews, fixtures, and localization from producer-owned data.
- [x] Add standalone and aggregate-capable mode matrix tests.
- [x] Wire the new test into aggregate repository checks, CI workflow structure, Git hook metadata, final-gate coverage, and test-plan policy.
- [x] Promote this sync ID to implemented after runtime implementation and targeted verification.

Active constraints:

- No existing-feature tradeoff is allowed.
- STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, existing CI, existing checks, existing document routes, repo-local skills, product-security, product authority, and Dashboard Settings safety remain constraints.
- Existing `GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` remains the Git action-permission policy when Git is used; it must not become the "whether Git is used" policy.
- React may display producer-owned applicability but must not infer policy from menu labels.

Verification state:

- [x] `bash -n` passed for the changed shell tools and test scripts during implementation.
- [x] `tools/test_product_git_usage_modes.sh` passed.
- [x] `tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh` passed.
- [x] `tools/test_product_scaffold_check.sh` passed.

- [x] Final sync and structure checks passed after the implemented documentation state was recorded.
- [x] `git diff --check` passed after implementation and document updates.
- [x] Sub-agent verification completed with no unresolved major findings after review fixes.

Next Step:

- This implementation step is closed. Continue future product workflow Git usage mode changes through a new synced task or explicit developer direction.

- [x] Promote the sync ID from `planned` to `implemented` after implementation and focused local verification.
- [x] Register `repository-development-workflow status` as an explicit final-gate gap command and coverage row after full/no-cache verification exposed the missing aggregate requirement.

Active constraints:

- No existing-feature tradeoff is allowed.
- STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, existing CI, existing checks, existing document routes, repo-local skills, security gates, Git hooks, pre-commit, and final-gate proof remain constraints.
- `worklog-doc-sync` remains responsible for product-document synchronization; `lesson-sync-gate` remains responsible for final lesson/gate closure.
- The new skill must guide phase selection and verification scope without bypassing approvals, release gates, or destructive-operation policy.

Verification state:

Current task state:

- [x] Use `$repository-development-workflow` and select the `implementation_plan` phase.
- [x] Confirm the current phase allows document synchronization only and requires developer approval before runtime implementation.
- [x] Define the planned direction: an approval-bound runner for phase detection, dry-run planning, allowed local check execution, execution records, conservative PASS reuse, next-phase stop decisions, release proof, and main-sync cleanup boundaries.
- [x] Keep the existing policy-backed skill implementation as the foundation rather than replacing it.
- [x] Preserve AGENTS.MD as the highest-priority rule source.

- [x] Keep merge, main CI waiting, local/remote sync, branch/worktree deletion, remote deletion, product-repository deletion, and cleanup execution approval-bound.
- [x] Synchronize this runner work across the requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, and sync contract.
- [x] Obtain developer approval before runtime implementation.
- [x] Implement runner policy, helper, CLI subcommands, record schema, tests, and skill guidance after approval.

- [x] Add a runner owner-layer helper.
- [x] Extend `tools/repository-development-workflow` with `detect`, `plan-run`, `run`, `record`, `next`, and `status --runs`.
- [x] Add a local, ignored runner-record directory after approval.
- [x] Add conservative fingerprint-based PASS reuse for fast and mid-test phases.
- [x] Keep release gate strict and non-reusable from fast-loop records.
- [x] Extend standalone and aggregate-capable runner tests.
- [x] Update repo-local skill guidance.

Active constraints:

- No existing-feature tradeoff is allowed.
- STEP 1-7, STEP 1-14, existing CI, existing checks, existing document routes, repo-local skills, security gates, Git hooks, pre-commit, and final-gate proof remain constraints.
- The runner must use existing policy and check catalogs rather than hard-coded command lists.
- Runtime implementation must stop if approval, release proof, security, or cleanup boundaries become ambiguous.

Next Step:

- Move to `mid_tests` only after reviewing the implemented diff and running any additional medium checks selected by the workflow contract.

Current Status:

- [x] Confirmed the active protocol is `$repository-development-workflow`.
- [x] Added product-local standard scaffold rows for `.gitignore`, product memory, workflow security and verification notes, repository index, product-local skills, and product-local tools.
- [x] Added parent-side product gate evidence bootstrap so external repositories can install Dashboard-readable evidence producer files without UI-only inference.
- [x] Added product-head freshness enforcement so evidence from a previous product commit becomes stale instead of ready.
- [x] Updated product scaffold fixtures used by scaffold, authority, gate, Git usage, launch, and dashboard data tests.
- [x] Added `--ci-optional` to `tools/product-scaffold-check` while keeping direct default execution strict.
- [x] Connected `product_workflow_git_usage_scaffold_gate` so Settings-selected non-CI modes do not require CI files.
- [x] Added explicit `--git-optional` support to `tools/product-launch-check` while preserving strict default behavior.
- [x] Updated Dashboard data so external-product Git operation modes are evaluated against the configured product repository.
- [x] Updated AGENTS routing, Free Development guidance, templates, and product workflow skill guidance to describe the product-local scaffold model.
- [x] Added focused regression coverage for product-local skills/tools, CI-optional scaffold behavior, Git-optional launch behavior, and dashboard product-context data.

Implemented goal:

- Built the next Design Studio foundation as a proposal orchestration layer, not as an arbitrary CSS editor or one-off image editor.
- Preserved the implemented source-to-runtime design-system contract and the current guarded Design Studio plan/apply behavior.
- Added design contracts for natural-language design requests, AI/manual/API proposal generation, imagegen mock generation, simple mock editing, mock-to-design-system candidate extraction, template reuse, event-runner jobs, target adapters, audit, atomic apply, and rollback-ready evidence.
- Kept AI output, mock artifacts, templates, and external product files proposal-only/candidate-only until explicit approval and owner-tool mutation boundaries apply.

Implemented tasks:

- [x] Select the new sync ID `dashboard_design_studio_orchestration_foundation`.
- [x] Review the proposal with multiple read-only sub-agent perspectives before writing runtime code.
- [x] Build the repository-development-workflow implementation plan.
- [x] Add this planned sync ID to the as-built sync contract.
- [x] Synchronize planned requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, and handoff.
- [x] Run the implementation-plan phase required sync checks.
- [x] Repair the existing design-system CI wiring contract surfaced by the sync check without changing runtime behavior.
- [x] Confirm the Dashboard design-system standalone drift check still passes after the CI wiring repair.
- [x] Before runtime implementation, inventory the dirty worktree and separate existing Design Studio changes from this sync ID.
- [x] Add `orchestration.json` as the machine-readable source for schemas, states, provider modes, target adapters, store, runner, mock, template, verification, and rollback contracts.
- [x] Define `DesignIntentRequest`, `DesignChangeProposal`, `CandidateEnvelope`, `MockArtifact`, `MockAnalysisProposal`, `TemplateDefinition`, `TemplateProposal`, and `ApplyEvidence` schemas.
- [x] Define shared state vocabulary for requests, jobs, proposals, candidates, templates, apply, verification, stale, rejected, manual-required, rollback-ready, and blocked states.
- [x] Add standalone design-system source validation for orchestration schemas, provider policy, secret-reference-only API mode, target authority, runtime wiring, and documentation anchors.
- [x] Add Request / Proposal Store planning and owner-layer boundaries.
- [x] Add Event Runner planning for durable job IDs, status, retry, timeout, cancel, dead-letter, idempotency, target lock, and audit.
- [x] Add AI Agent Connection Layer policy for manual, subscription-agent, and API-key modes.
- [x] Add Target Adapter boundaries for Dashboard and external product targets.
- [x] Keep external product apply plan-only until product-local mutation contract is separately approved.
- [x] Add Mock Candidate Library, Mock Edit Loop, Mock-to-Design-System Bridge, and Template Library MVP contracts.
- [x] Render the orchestration foundation in Design Studio with localized labels and focused Dashboard coverage.
- [x] Promote this sync ID to implemented after runtime artifacts, standalone checks, focused Dashboard checks, and required synchronization metadata updates.

Implemented scope:

- Product repository structure now requires product-local AGENTS.MD, ops/PRODUCT_OPERATION_MODE.tsv, and tools/product-mode as part of the standard external-product scaffold.
- Product-local AGENT.md is no longer a valid scaffold entry. Scaffold and authority checks surface it as a legacy migration/deletion target after product AGENTS.MD is validated.
- ops/PRODUCT_OPERATION_MODE.tsv stores workflow_mode, managed_by_parent, parent_repository, parent_rules_ref, last_parent_sync, active_parent_run, local_agents_version, and routing_table_version.
- tools/product-repository-mode provides lesson-side status, check, attach, detach, and reconnect paths. Status and check are read-only; attach, detach, and reconnect require --confirm and update only the operation-mode manifest.
- Product authority JSON exposes operation_mode.status, workflow_mode, rule_connection_status, repair_reason, and next_safe_action so Dashboard data can display mode diagnostics without React inventing readiness.
- Product fixtures, templates, document tour text, prompts, and product docs skills now use product-side AGENTS.MD as the standard rulebook and keep legacy AGENT.md only as a migration target.
- Git hooks, test-plan policy, CI structure checks, CI workflows, and the aggregate lesson-repository test include the product operation-mode regression.

Current Status:

- [x] Confirmed the approved proposal: external product workflows need multiple repository support and menu selection must be separated from repository selection.
- [x] Verified Browser Debug CLI is a ready free-development external repository after the adjacent CLI initialized Git and product-gate evidence.
- [x] Added the planned registry schema source for registry and selection rows.
- [x] Synchronized the planned requirements, specification, implementation plan, TASK_TRACKER, HANDOFF, and AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT metadata.
- [x] Implemented parent-side registry learning state and resolver helpers for read-only lookup.
- [x] Added `tools/product-repository-registry status|list|selected|verify`.
- [x] Added read-only multi-repository verification for `free-development` with `--all` and optional `--require-authority-ready`.
- [x] Verified the current temporary free-development repositories: `frame-cue` and `browser-debug-cli`.
- [x] Added focused dashboard-data coverage proving selected `browser-debug-cli` does not fall back to `frame-cue` or `task-tracker-repository`.
- [x] Added Playwright coverage for selected `browser-debug-cli` across Dashboard, Repository Info, Documents, and Update History.
- [x] Connected the four overview cards to evidence `source_id/current_item_id` attributes and verified detail-page live evidence rows point to the same evidence.
- [x] Performed Playwright screenshot review for Dashboard, Development Workflow, and Safety Actions on desktop and mobile; fixed menu-tile text clipping found during review.
- [x] Added the first evidence taxonomy v1 contract slice for concrete test and structure source IDs, including `product.structure.*` namespace validation and `product.structure.files/settings/scripts` writer/authority coverage through `structure-status`.
- [x] Extended product-local `git-status` to record detailed `product.git.sync`, `product.git.push`, `product.git.pr`, and `product.git.merge` evidence rows while keeping PR/merge as manual-required observations rather than unverified pass states.
- [x] Added product-local `ci-status` evidence for declared CI manifest/provider readiness while preserving existing current authoritative CI run evidence and keeping unobserved PR CI manual-required.
- [x] Added product-local `security-status` evidence for secret-bearing path blockers, local artifact hygiene, external-sending approval readiness, and aggregate security blockers without storing secret values.
- [x] Added focused no-target registry fixtures proving Product Improvement and External Integration remain `not_selected` without explicit registry selection, and Free Development remains `not_selected` when no eligible Free Development repository exists.
- [x] Implemented guarded `tools/product-repository-registry register` and `select` mutation with `--confirm`, external path validation, safe ID/context/product-type validation, duplicate replacement protection, and context-compatible selection checks.
- [x] Extended product-local `manifest-tests` fixtures so concrete `product.tests.unit`, `product.tests.smoke`, and `product.tests.e2e` rows are recorded and read back through parent-side authority detail metadata.
- [x] Added producer-owned `repository_selection` data and schema coverage for current repository identity, eligible candidates, disabled reasons, and guarded selection command previews.
- [x] Added Dashboard Control Center validation and a read-only repository selection panel that keeps repository switching as a guarded CLI preview rather than browser-side mutation.
- [x] Added Playwright coverage proving selected `browser-debug-cli` appears in the repository selection panel and does not leak `frame-cue` or raw local paths.
- [x] Promoted the sync ID to implemented after the remaining selection UX scope and contract-required focused checks passed.

Next Step:

- `external_product_repository_registry` is implemented for parent-side registry, guarded register/select mutation, Dashboard read-only repository selection UX, and focused evidence fixtures.
- Future real PR/main CI run collectors remain a separate approval-bound scope; do not add GitHub/network authority through this implemented sync.
- Before editing future runtime code, read `AGENTS.MD`, `skills/repository-development-workflow/SKILL.md`, and this handoff block, then run the relevant focused checks for the changed owner layer.

## Implemented Product CI Run Evidence Collector Work

SYNC-ID: product_ci_run_evidence_collector
STATUS: implemented
ARTIFACTS: docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv,docs/workflow/PRODUCT_GATE_EVIDENCE_SCHEMA.tsv,docs/workflow/TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv,tools/product-gate-evidence-bootstrap,tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh,docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md,docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md,docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md,docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md
TESTS: tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh,tools/test_product_scaffold_check.sh,tools/test_product_repository_authority.sh,tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh,tools/check_as_built_docs.sh,tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh,tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh,tools/test_test_plan.sh

Current Status:

- [x] Added generated product-local `tools/product-gate-evidence ci-runs` for explicit CI run evidence collection.
- [x] Kept `ci-status` local-only and non-networked.
- [x] Recorded current-head main CI run evidence under `product.ci.main` using `gh run list --json` and declared CI manifest rows.
- [x] Recorded PR CI evidence under `product.ci.pr` only when `--pr` is provided, using `gh pr view --json` and head/check-state validation.
- [x] Preserved provider visibility and failure semantics under `product.ci.github_actions`.
- [x] Added focused fake-`gh` coverage proving generated product-local tooling writes authoritative main and PR CI evidence and parent-side authority can read it.
- [x] Updated the evidence schema and test-plan policy for the new explicit collector.

Next Step:

- Continue verification through focused product authority, as-built sync, test-plan, workflow-pair, fast-loop, and mid-test checks.
- Do not move CI run collection into Dashboard data; Dashboard remains a read-only consumer of existing product evidence rows.

## Implemented CI Final Gate Gap-Only Safety Work

SYNC-ID: ci_final_gate_gap_only_safety
STATUS: implemented
ARTIFACTS: docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv,docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_COVERAGE.tsv,docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_GAP_COMMANDS.tsv,tools/ci-final-gate,tools/test_ci_final_gate.sh,docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md,docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md,docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md,docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md,docs/memory/SESSION_MEMORY.md
TESTS: tools/test_ci_final_gate.sh,tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh,tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh,tools/check_as_built_docs.sh,tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh

Current Status:

- [x] Added aggregate coverage validation to `tools/ci-final-gate --gap-only`.
- [x] Preserved the default final-gate evidence and aggregate fallback behavior.
- [x] Added a focused uncovered aggregate fixture proving `--gap-only` fails closed.
- [x] Added a focused valid fixture proving `--gap-only` reports coverage-and-command success only after validation.
- [x] Added cached active-command and Git hook runner lookups to `tools/as-built-sync status` after release proof exposed repeated status scans.
- [x] Synchronized the new sync ID across the as-built contract, as-built documents, TASK_TRACKER, HANDOFF, and session memory.
- [x] Passed focused, fast-loop, mid-test, aggregate, full/no-cache hook, and pre-commit verification.

Next Step:

- Continue remaining approved implementation slices as separate sync IDs.
- Do not accept any existing-feature tradeoff, CI-name change, full/no-cache reduction, Dashboard behavior change, or product repository behavior change in later slices.
## Implemented Product Authority Evidence Detail Contract Work

Sync ID: `product_authority_evidence_detail_contract`.
Current status: `implemented`.
Priority: 2.

Implemented task state:

- [x] Confirm product authority evidence detail fields are producer-owned and already emitted by the authority layer.
- [x] Promote Dashboard schema rows for evidence item detail fields to `implemented`.
- [x] Add schema rows for emitted `context`, `max_age_seconds`, and `product_root`.
- [x] Strengthen Dashboard runtime validation for evidence item context, requirement flag, freshness support fields, product head, safe paths, decision text, and risk level.
- [x] Update Dashboard fixtures to include the detail contract fields.
- [x] Add focused tests for producer output, Dashboard schema, and Dashboard data validation.

Current status: `implemented`.
Priority: 2.

Implemented task state:

- [x] Add `tools/dashboard-browser-debug-manifest` as the lesson-owned generator for Browser Debug CLI Dashboard Control Center review manifests.
- [x] Keep workflow, Git, CI, blocker, repository-selection, and next-safe-action semantics in bounded lesson-side `sourceData` and rubric configuration.
- [x] Add `tools/test_dashboard_browser_debug_manifest.sh` for standalone manifest-contract validation.
- [x] Wire the focused test into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
