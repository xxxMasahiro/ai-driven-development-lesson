# TASK_TRACKER.md

## Current Status

The lesson repository includes mechanical enforcement, flexible lesson entry, Free Development Mode, Team Development and Docker advanced module, dialogue-centered learning, as-built synchronization checks, sub-agent review protocol, menu/dashboard/illustration entry points, 7-day and 14-day lesson language controls, and lesson-side aggregate testing.

The current task implements the follow-up requirement that 7-day lessons must have the same learning-mode, workflow display language, and product development language controls that were added to the 14-day lesson.
It also expands the shared language list for both lesson versions to `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`, while keeping `zh` as a `zh-CN` alias and preserving `custom` language flexibility.
The implementation remains additive and keeps the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, free-development flow, advanced modules, existing checks, and repository-boundary behavior intact.

## Completed

- Recorded developer feedback in `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Added 14-day approval receipts and enforcement.
- Added learning mode A/B/C selection and switching for 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Added workflow display language and product development language controls for 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Added shared standard language choices for 7-day and 14-day language settings.
- Added setup.index gates so both structured lessons require learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language before passing the entry step.
- Added learner-selected start position commands for 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Added 14-day runtime reset command.
- Added `tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh`.
- Added `tools/test_lesson_start_position.sh`.
- Added `tools/test_production_operations.sh` for explicit real product operations testing.
- Kept `task-tracker-repository` deleted for the current lesson-side validation scope.
- Added Free Development Mode.
- Added Team Development and Docker advanced module.
- Added Docker learning paths for installed and not-installed environments.
- Added agent dialogue and wall-bouncing as core lesson content.
- Added sub-agent orchestration guidance.
- Added MCP purpose-before-workflow guidance for Step 13/14.
- Hardened GitHub Actions CI status checking.
- Added as-built document consistency checks.
- Added sub-agent review protocol checks.
- Added lesson-repository aggregate test.
- Added product-gate tool tests that use a temporary product repository and fake CI response.
- Added `tools/test_lesson.sh` for 7-day setup gating and settings regression coverage.
- Added a non-English Markdown listing tool for translation follow-up.
- Added learner-facing menu, dashboard, and illustration review entry points.
- Documented implementation quality constraints: refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality.
- Preserved the no-tradeoff rule for existing features.
- Added as-built lesson-side documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`

## Implemented Remediation Summary

The following developer-memory remediation items are implemented and mechanically verified:

1. Add shared document-path support for design/as-built, workflow-state, and memory/decision documents.
2. Safely migrate role-specific Markdown documents into directories while keeping `AGENTS.MD` at root.
3. Replace learner-facing `Day N` labels with `Step N` labels where practical.
4. Hide internal step IDs from ordinary learner-facing output.
5. Implement separate workflow display language and product development language settings for both structured lessons.
6. Enforce learner-facing learning-mode display names while preserving A/B/C internal IDs.
7. Strengthen start/pass approval gates and approval/action pairing checks.
8. Improve passage prompts and copy-paste command-block explanations.
9. Enforce `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized workflow-state pair.
10. Strengthen as-built synchronization beyond shallow topic checks.
11. Expand CLI dashboard lesson and development views to match developer-memory requirements, including separate 7-day and 14-day language settings.
12. Complete illustration request metadata, generated-asset registration, and review-page display.
13. Add an external-integration CLI path with `status`, `start`, and `gate`.
14. Require Playwright checks for lesson-repository dashboard and illustration-review quality after dependencies are installed.
15. Wire strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
16. Add Free Development and Team Development gate failure-path tests.

## Current Synchronization Task

- Synchronize the implemented 7-day parity change into the three design/as-built documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Synchronize the same implemented state into the two workflow-state documents:
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`
- Treat the synchronization as passing only when the implemented content is present in all five documents.
- Preserve refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusable design, generality, and the no-existing-feature-tradeoff rule while maintaining the implemented remediation.

## Verification Status

Required lesson-side verification target:

```text
7-day lesson CLI tests passed.
Lesson14 CLI tests passed.
Lesson repository test passed.
```

Latest local verification reached this target after synchronizing the 7-day parity implementation and the expanded language-list implementation.
Real product operations testing remains available through `tools/test_production_operations.sh` when an external product repository is intentionally recreated.

## Remaining Work

- Commit and push only after all local checks pass.
- Translate remaining learner-facing Markdown files to English using the audit output from `tools/list_non_english_docs.sh`.
