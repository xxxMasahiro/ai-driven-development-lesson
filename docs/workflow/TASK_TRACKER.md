# TASK_TRACKER.md

## Current Status

The lesson repository includes mechanical enforcement, flexible lesson entry, Free Development Mode, Team Development and Docker advanced module, dialogue-centered learning, as-built synchronization checks, sub-agent review protocol, menu/dashboard/illustration entry points, 7-day and 14-day lesson language controls, and lesson-side aggregate testing.

The previous implemented change promotes the Git workflow policy into a shared menu-level policy for menu items 1 through 7, including branch permission, `git worktree` permission, direct-main permission, automation level, Git monitoring, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
The previous implemented change added user-configurable Git workflow policy settings and the as-built sync contract that mechanically enforces synchronization across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
The current implemented Git workflow action settings split Git workflow behavior into detailed settings for commit, push, PR creation, PR CI monitoring, merge execution, developer-responsibility auto-merge, main CI monitoring, and local/remote sync monitoring.
The current implemented Git hooks policy provides faster safe serial pre-commit operation through `full`, `fast`, and `minimal` modes, conservative Git-local caching, and a path-based local full/no-cache recommendation command.
The current implemented resource-budgeted parallel guard provides safe optional parallel execution decisions for Git hooks, Playwright, CI, and aggregate checks through user-configured memory and swap budgets.
The current implemented test and CI safe time optimization first phase adds observe-only Test Plan Manifest behavior, Coverage Guard, Result Attestation, CI-safe Git hooks parallelism, and lightweight fixture-copy optimization while preserving full/no-cache verification.
The current planned learner context foundation prepares source documents under `learning/context/` for the next lesson-content implementation cycle; runtime lesson output has not been changed by that foundation step.
The current planned learner context runtime integration separates learning context from workflow context; Free Development Mode remains a workflow, not a lesson.
The current implemented SafeFlow security backfill adds repository-level security invariants, a policy table, a reusable checker, standalone tests, aggregate-test wiring, Git hooks wiring, CI wiring, and pre-commit wiring.
The current implemented product security workflow gate adds `tools/product-security status|preflight|advise|check|gate` for menu items 4, 5, and 6 while preserving their existing document, repository-boundary, Git sync, CI, and approval gates.
Safe product repository cleanup remains implemented for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
It also preserves the 7-day and 14-day learning-mode, workflow display language, product development language, and expanded language-list controls.
The shared standard language list remains `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`, while `zh` remains a `zh-CN` alias and `custom` remains available.
The implementation remains additive and keeps the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, free-development flow, advanced modules, existing checks, and repository-boundary behavior intact.

## Implemented Documentation Map Synchronization

The lesson now explains the repository's rule, routing, skill, design, workflow, and memory documents in a way that non-engineer learners can understand.
Runtime implementation is complete and the docs map artifacts are present.

- Added `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills as the agent-facing rule and navigation layer.
- Distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.
- Explain `docs/as-built/` as the requirements, specification, and implementation-plan area.
- Explain `docs/workflow/` as the task-tracker and handoff area.
- Explain `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, and `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv` as Git hook policy and current local hook-mode controls.
- Explain `docs/memory/` as memory and decision records, including `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Explain product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records without claiming a lesson-side failure-memory file exists.
- Added `tools/docs-tour` with `status`, `rules`, `design`, `workflow`, `memory`, `skills`, and `all` views.
- Made `tools/docs-tour` adapt to learning modes A/B/C.
- Added `./tools/dashboard docs` and included that view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Added copy-paste prompt examples for asking an agent to explain `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` and the as-built trio in learner-friendly language.
- Added early 7-day and 14-day guidance so learners understand why the documents exist before they use them deeply.
- Added `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and wired it into structure/as-built/developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, skills, memory workflow, and repository-boundary behavior.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- The validation suite must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Product Repository Cleanup Synchronization

The lesson now provides a safe, explicit cleanup path for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `tools/product-repository-cleanup`.
- Support `status`, `plan`, `local`, and `remote` subcommands.
- Keep `status` and `plan` non-destructive.

- Keep local deletion and remote deletion separate; do not add `all` or automatic chained deletion.
- Reject local deletion unless the target is the configured external product repository path, normally `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository`.
- Reject local deletion when the target is inside the lesson repository, does not match the configured product repository name, is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, is not the Git top level, or cannot be identified safely.
- Require GitHub authentication and a successful remote repository lookup before any remote deletion attempt.
- Show the remote URL and owner/repository name before any remote deletion.
- Print a clear operation log for status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths.
- Added `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
- Test status, plan, missing confirmation, wrong confirmation, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- Do not delete a real GitHub repository in lesson-repository tests.
- Wired the cleanup test into structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Exposed runtime discovery through README, AGENTS routing, menu item 5, and the dashboard development view.

## Implemented As-Built Sync Contract Synchronization

The lesson now strengthens mechanical enforcement across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` as the contract source for synchronized improvement IDs.
- Record each synchronized improvement with `sync_id`, `status`, `title`, `required_artifacts`, `required_tests`, `required_docs`, and `runtime_evidence`.
- Added matching `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks to all five synchronized documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`,

  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
- Added `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Fail when a contract sync ID is missing from any of the five documents.
- Fail when any of the five documents contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- Fail when the same sync ID is marked `planned` in one document and `implemented` in another.
- Fail when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- Fail when required artifacts or required tests are missing from the repository.
- Fail when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- Fail when an implemented sync ID's required tests are not actively wired into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Keep `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh` and its topic-based checks active.
- Call `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` from `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Keep `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` active for the `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` pair.
- Added `tools/as-built-sync status` to show sync IDs, document coverage, artifact presence, and test wiring.
- Added `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Test complete synchronization, missing document block, unknown sync ID, mixed status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifact, inert wiring, and missing active test-wiring failure paths.
- Added `AGENTS.MD` routing and standard-check references for sync-contract status and validation.
- Wired the validator and regression test into `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, docs-tour, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Planned Learner Context Foundation Synchronization

The lesson now has a planned learner-context foundation for the next implementation cycle.
This is documentation foundation work only; lesson runtime output is not yet changed.

- Added `learning/context/README.md`.
- Added `learning/context/AI_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT_FOUNDATION.md`.
- Added `learning/context/SECURITY_FOUNDATION.md`.
- Added `learning/context/LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`.
- Updated `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md` so the context directory is discoverable.
- Added `learner_context_foundation` to `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` with `STATUS: planned`.
- Added matching planned sync blocks to the three as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
- Preserved existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, docs-tour, product-repository cleanup, sync-contract, CI, and pre-commit behavior.
- Next implementation work should connect the context map to lesson openings, per-topic explanations, final recaps, prompt display, security guidance, and dashboard review surfaces.

## Planned Learner Context Runtime Integration Synchronization

The next planned implementation connects learner context to runtime output while preserving the distinction between lessons and workflows.

- Learning context targets are 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, and applied lesson.
- Workflow context targets are Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson repository maintenance.
- Free Development Mode remains a workflow that applies the learned AI-driven development process to user-selected products.
- Planned runtime artifacts include `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`, `tools/lesson-context`, `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`, and `tools/test_lesson_context.sh`.
- Planned integration points include `tools/lesson`, `tools/lesson14`, `tools/team-development`, `tools/free-development`, `tools/product-improvement`, `tools/external-integration`, `tools/menu`, and `tools/dashboard`.
- Planned tests must run standalone and through aggregate checks, CI, and pre-commit.
- Current work is synchronization only; runtime output is not yet changed.

## Implemented Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The Git workflow policy lets users choose how much Git management and Git automation the workflow agent may perform.
This is implemented runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Added `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` for supported Git workflow policy definitions.
- Added `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` for the current user-selected Git workflow settings.
- Added `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for shared setting loading, validation, permission checks, automation-level helpers, repository-context detection, and Git monitoring.
- Added `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the learner/agent command surface.
- Support working-branch permission, `git worktree` permission, and main-direct-work permission.
- Support automation levels:
  - `manual`: guidance only.
  - `commit`: commit may be automated after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks may be automated.
  - `sync`: main CI plus local/remote synchronization checks may be automated.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Monitor uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local/remote divergence, unnecessary working branches, unnecessary worktrees, and whether the current repository is the lesson, product, or a custom repository.
- Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.
- Keep cleanup planning non-destructive.
- Reuse existing repository-boundary, Git sync, menu prerequisite, dashboard, and aggregate-test patterns.
- Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` for settings validation, permission decisions, automation-level decisions, dirty-state detection, local/remote sync monitoring, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- Wired validation into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.

## Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The implemented improvement promotes Git workflow policy from an independent support setting to a shared menu-level policy.
This is runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the existing policy source.
- Make menu categories reference the same Git policy:
  - learning paths: 7-day, 14-day, and applied lesson,
  - building/extending paths: Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, and External Integration,
  - maintenance path: lesson repository improvement.
- Show Git policy readiness in `tools/menu readiness` for menu items 1 through 7.
- Added Git policy validation to `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` without weakening existing menu prerequisites.
- Added `tools/menu check 7` and `tools/menu start 7 --confirm` as a safe lesson-maintenance path.
- Keep `automation_level=manual` valid and non-blocking.
- Interpret automation levels consistently as guidance-only, commit, PR/CI, and sync scopes.
- Keep destructive Git operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Show menu-wide Git policy status in dashboard output.
- Added tests for valid policy readiness, invalid policy values, item 1 through 7 checks, missing policy files, and no-tradeoff behavior.

## Implemented Git Workflow Action Settings Synchronization

The implemented improvement splits Git workflow automation into action-by-action manual or automatic settings.
It remains additive and must not trade away existing Git policy, menu, dashboard, cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep existing settings:
  - `branch_allowed`
  - `worktree_allowed`
  - `main_direct_work_allowed`
  - `automation_level`
- Treat `automation_level` as a compatibility preset.
- Detailed settings take precedence only when the detailed setting key is present.
- Fall back to `automation_level` when a detailed setting key is absent so current implemented behavior is preserved.
- Add detailed settings:
  - `commit_automation: manual|auto`
  - `push_automation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_creation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `merge_execution: manual|after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false|true`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: manual|auto`
- Implemented defaults:
  - `commit_automation: auto`
  - `push_automation: manual`
  - `pr_creation: manual`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `merge_execution: after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: auto`
- These detailed defaults are active after implementation; `automation_level` remains available as a compatibility preset when detailed action keys are absent.
- Add shared action-mode resolution in `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for `commit`, `push`, `pr`, `ci`, `pr_ci`, `merge`, `main_ci`, and `sync`.
- Keep `ci` as a compatibility alias for CI monitoring so existing `tools/git-workflow allow ci` behavior is preserved.
- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set` as the setting surface.
- Show detailed settings in `tools/menu readiness` and `tools/dashboard menu`.
- Apply the settings to menu items 1 through 7.
- For push and PR creation, `auto` means the agent may execute the operation only after explicit approval for that operation is recorded; it never means approval-free execution.
- `merge_execution: after_approval` means the agent may execute merge only after explicit merge approval is recorded.
- `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_APPROVALS.tsv` stores matching action, repository, and branch approval receipts for detailed push, PR creation, and normal merge execution.
- `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` is the only implemented path for developer-responsibility approval-free merge and requires PR CI success, clear target PR and branch, verified merge base, clean working tree, checked local/remote state, and stop-on-failure behavior.
- Developer-responsibility auto-merge requires gate evidence plus actual repository checks; the setting alone does not permit approval-free merge.
- Keep branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository deletion behind explicit user confirmation regardless of merge settings.
- Add tests for defaults, valid changes, invalid values, detailed-setting precedence, menu display, dashboard display, and preservation of existing workflows.

## Implemented Git Hooks Policy Synchronization

The implemented improvement provides the runtime path for faster pre-commit execution.
It is synchronized as `git_hooks_policy` with `STATUS: implemented`.

- Keep the current pre-commit behavior as the safety baseline.
- Keep hooks serial and avoid a normal learner-facing `off` mode.
- Add implemented modes:
  - `full`: current-equivalent required pre-commit coverage.
  - `fast`: conservative cache-assisted execution that skips only checks with unchanged successful inputs.
  - `minimal`: quick local mechanical feedback that is not enough for final completion by itself.
- Store cache data outside version control under a Git-local cache path such as `.git/pre-commit-cache/`.
- Fail closed on missing, stale, corrupted, or unverifiable cache entries.
- Fail closed on malformed `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` rows, including invalid or empty mode tokens.
- Store the hook check list in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`.
- Store the local full/no-cache recommendation path policy in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`.
- Provide a reusable command surface for hook status, mode selection, cache clearing, normal run, no-cache run, and explicit mode run.
- Provide a reusable recommendation surface so local full/no-cache is recommended for Git hooks, CI, checks, tests, or as-built synchronization changes, while ordinary local work can stay on the selected mode such as `minimal`.
- Connect the implementation to existing settings files, `tools/lib` helpers, aggregate tests, CI, pre-commit, and repo-local skills.
- Preserve existing wiring enforcement by teaching the existing checks and status output to recognize runner-based pre-commit dispatch.
- Keep CI and completion verification on full or no-cache execution.
- Add `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` for standalone policy/cache validation, invalid persisted settings, malformed check rows, invalid or empty mode tokens, invalidation, no-cache behavior, minimal-mode coverage, failing-check cache refusal, and safe cache clearing.
- Extend `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` for local verification recommendation behavior.
- Verify full/no-cache coverage, aggregate wiring, CI wiring, and preservation of existing checks through `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and the CI workflow definitions.
- Require developer approval before changing the minimal-mode required check list or using cache to skip Playwright-related checks beyond the implemented fail-closed behavior.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Control

Shared menu prerequisite control is implemented without replacing existing lesson or product workflows.

- Rename the learner-facing menu item to `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the Team Development and Docker path available through the renamed applied-learning item.
- Require learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context/boundary confirmation where relevant, and learner approval before starting menu items 1 through 6.
- Reuse existing 7-day and 14-day settings where available.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the most recently configured structured-lesson settings when possible; otherwise require missing settings before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for product-side work.
- Implement the prerequisite logic through shared reusable helpers rather than duplicated menu branches.
- Keep `status` commands non-blocking for discovery; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Add a mechanically checkable product-improvement entry point for menu item 5.
- Expand dashboard readiness output for menu items 1 through 6.
- Add tests for the renamed menu label, absence of the old learner-facing label, missing-prerequisite failure paths, unchanged existing 7-day/14-day behavior, and preservation of existing Free Development, Team Development, external-integration, dashboard, and product-gate checks.

## Verification Status

Required lesson-side verification target:

```text
7-day lesson CLI tests passed.
Lesson14 CLI tests passed.
Lesson repository test passed.
```

Implemented local verification reached this target after synchronizing the 7-day parity implementation and the expanded language-list implementation.
The implemented verification target also includes `Menu prerequisite tests passed.`
The implemented verification target also includes `Product repository cleanup tests passed.`
The implemented verification target also includes `As-built sync contract tests passed.`
The implemented verification target also includes `Git workflow policy tests passed.`
The implemented verification target also includes `Git hooks policy tests passed.`
Current local pre-commit mode remains selectable through `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv`; CI and final verification remain full/no-cache.
The implemented verification sequence includes `./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `./tools/as-built-sync status`, `./tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `./tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh`, `./tools/test_git_hooks.sh`, `./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`, and `.githooks/pre-commit`.
Real product operations testing remains available through `tools/test_production_operations.sh` when an external product repository is intentionally recreated.

## Remaining Work

- Commit and push only after all local checks pass.
- Translate remaining learner-facing Markdown files to English using the audit output from `tools/list_non_english_docs.sh`.
