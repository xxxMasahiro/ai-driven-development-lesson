# TASK_TRACKER.md

## Current Status

The lesson repository includes mechanical enforcement, flexible lesson entry, Free Development Mode, Team Development and Docker advanced module, dialogue-centered learning, as-built synchronization checks, sub-agent review protocol, menu/dashboard/illustration entry points, 7-day and 14-day lesson language controls, and lesson-side aggregate testing.

The latest implemented change promotes the Git workflow policy into a shared menu-level policy for menu items 1 through 7, including branch permission, `git worktree` permission, direct-main permission, automation level, Git monitoring, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
The previous implemented change added user-configurable Git workflow policy settings and the as-built sync contract that mechanically enforces synchronization across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
Safe product repository cleanup remains implemented for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
It also preserves the 7-day and 14-day learning-mode, workflow display language, product development language, and expanded language-list controls.
The shared standard language list remains `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`, while `zh` remains a `zh-CN` alias and `custom` remains available.
The implementation remains additive and keeps the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, free-development flow, advanced modules, existing checks, and repository-boundary behavior intact.

## Implemented Remediation Summary

The following developer-memory remediation items are implemented and mechanically verified:

1. Add shared document-path support for design/as-built, workflow-state, and memory/decision documents.
2. Safely migrate role-specific Markdown documents into directories while keeping `AGENTS.MD` at root.
3. Replace learner-facing `Day N` labels with `Step N` labels where practical.
4. Hide internal step IDs from ordinary learner-facing output.
5. Implement separate workflow display language and product development language settings for both structured lessons.
6. Enforce learner-facing learning-mode display names while preserving A/B/C internal IDs.
7. Strengthen start/pass approval gates and approval/action pairing checks.
8. Improve passage prompts and copy-paste command-block explanations.
9. Enforce `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized workflow-state pair.
10. Strengthen as-built synchronization beyond shallow topic checks.
11. Expand CLI dashboard lesson and development views to match developer-memory requirements, including separate 7-day and 14-day language settings.
12. Complete illustration request metadata, generated-asset registration, and review-page display.
13. Add an external-integration CLI path with `status`, `start`, and `gate`.
14. Require Playwright checks for lesson-repository dashboard and illustration-review quality after dependencies are installed.
15. Wire strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
16. Add Free Development and Team Development gate failure-path tests.

## Current Synchronized State

- The implemented as-built sync-contract behavior is synchronized into the three design/as-built documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- The same implemented state is synchronized into the two workflow-state documents:
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`
- The implemented product repository cleanup behavior remains synchronized in the same five documents.
- The implemented menu prerequisite control remains synchronized in the same five documents.
- The implemented Git workflow policy behavior is synchronized in the same five documents.
- The synchronization passes only when the implemented content is present in all five documents.
- Preserve refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusable design, generality, and the no-existing-feature-tradeoff rule while maintaining the implemented remediation.

## Implemented Documentation Map Synchronization

The lesson now explains the repository's rule, routing, skill, design, workflow, and memory documents in a way that non-engineer learners can understand.
Runtime implementation is complete and the docs map artifacts are present.

- Added `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills as the agent-facing rule and navigation layer.
- Distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.
- Explain `docs/as-built/` as the requirements, specification, and implementation-plan area.
- Explain `docs/workflow/` as the task-tracker and handoff area.
- Explain `docs/memory/` as memory and decision records, including `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Explain product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records without claiming a lesson-side failure-memory file exists.
- Added `tools/docs-tour` with `status`, `rules`, `design`, `workflow`, `memory`, `skills`, and `all` views.
- Made `tools/docs-tour` adapt to learning modes A/B/C.
- Added `./tools/dashboard docs` and included that view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Added copy-paste prompt examples for asking an agent to explain `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` and the as-built trio in learner-friendly language.
- Added early 7-day and 14-day guidance so learners understand why the documents exist before they use them deeply.
- Added `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and wired it into structure/as-built/developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, skills, memory workflow, and repository-boundary behavior.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- The validation suite must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Product Repository Cleanup Synchronization

The lesson now provides a safe, explicit cleanup path for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `tools/product-repository-cleanup`.
- Support `status`, `plan`, `local`, and `remote` subcommands.
- Keep `status` and `plan` non-destructive.
- Require explicit confirmation for local cleanup with the configured product repository name, such as `task-tracker-repository`.
- Require explicit confirmation for remote cleanup with the full GitHub owner/repository name, such as `xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository`.
- Keep local deletion and remote deletion separate; do not add `all` or automatic chained deletion.
- Reject local deletion unless the target is the configured external product repository path, normally `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository`.
- Reject local deletion when the target is inside the lesson repository, does not match the configured product repository name, is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, is not the Git top level, or cannot be identified safely.
- Require GitHub authentication and a successful remote repository lookup before any remote deletion attempt.
- Show the remote URL and owner/repository name before any remote deletion.
- Print a clear operation log for status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths.
- Added `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
- Test status, plan, missing confirmation, wrong confirmation, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- Do not delete a real GitHub repository in lesson-repository tests.
- Wired the cleanup test into structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Exposed runtime discovery through README, AGENTS routing, menu item 5, and the dashboard development view.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented As-Built Sync Contract Synchronization

The lesson now strengthens mechanical enforcement across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
Runtime implementation is complete.

- Added `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` as the contract source for synchronized improvement IDs.
- Record each synchronized improvement with `sync_id`, `status`, `title`, `required_artifacts`, `required_tests`, `required_docs`, and `runtime_evidence`.
- Added matching `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks to all five synchronized documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
- Added `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Fail when a contract sync ID is missing from any of the five documents.
- Fail when any of the five documents contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- Fail when the same sync ID is marked `planned` in one document and `implemented` in another.
- Fail when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- Fail when required artifacts or required tests are missing from the repository.
- Fail when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- Fail when an implemented sync ID's required tests are not actively wired into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Keep `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh` and its topic-based checks active.
- Call `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` from `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Keep `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` active for the `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` pair.
- Added `tools/as-built-sync status` to show sync IDs, document coverage, artifact presence, and test wiring.
- Added `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Test complete synchronization, missing document block, unknown sync ID, mixed status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifact, inert wiring, and missing active test-wiring failure paths.
- Added `AGENTS.MD` routing and standard-check references for sync-contract status and validation.
- Wired the validator and regression test into `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, docs-tour, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The Git workflow policy lets users choose how much Git management and Git automation the workflow agent may perform.
This is implemented runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Added `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` for supported Git workflow policy definitions.
- Added `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` for the current user-selected Git workflow settings.
- Added `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for shared setting loading, validation, permission checks, automation-level helpers, repository-context detection, and Git monitoring.
- Added `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the learner/agent command surface.
- Support working-branch permission, `git worktree` permission, and main-direct-work permission.
- Support automation levels:
  - `manual`: guidance only.
  - `commit`: commit may be automated after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks may be automated.
  - `sync`: main CI plus local/remote synchronization checks may be automated.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Monitor uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local/remote divergence, unnecessary working branches, unnecessary worktrees, and whether the current repository is the lesson, product, or a custom repository.
- Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.
- Keep cleanup planning non-destructive.
- Reuse existing repository-boundary, Git sync, menu prerequisite, dashboard, and aggregate-test patterns.
- Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` for settings validation, permission decisions, automation-level decisions, dirty-state detection, local/remote sync monitoring, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- Wired validation into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.

## Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy Synchronization

The implemented improvement promotes Git workflow policy from an independent support setting to a shared menu-level policy.
This is runtime behavior.
It is additive and does not trade away existing lesson progression, approvals, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the existing policy source.
- Make menu categories reference the same Git policy:
  - learning paths: 7-day, 14-day, and applied lesson,
  - building/extending paths: Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, and External Integration,
  - maintenance path: lesson repository improvement.
- Show Git policy readiness in `tools/menu readiness` for menu items 1 through 7.
- Added Git policy validation to `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` without weakening existing menu prerequisites.
- Added `tools/menu check 7` and `tools/menu start 7 --confirm` as a safe lesson-maintenance path.
- Keep `automation_level=manual` valid and non-blocking.
- Interpret automation levels consistently as guidance-only, commit, PR/CI, and sync scopes.
- Keep destructive Git operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Show menu-wide Git policy status in dashboard output.
- Added tests for valid policy readiness, invalid policy values, item 1 through 7 checks, missing policy files, and no-tradeoff behavior.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Control

Shared menu prerequisite control is implemented without replacing existing lesson or product workflows.

- Rename the learner-facing menu item to `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the Team Development and Docker path available through the renamed applied-learning item.
- Require learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context/boundary confirmation where relevant, and learner approval before starting menu items 1 through 6.
- Reuse existing 7-day and 14-day settings where available.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the latest configured structured-lesson settings when possible; otherwise require missing settings before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for product-side work.
- Implement the prerequisite logic through shared reusable helpers rather than duplicated menu branches.
- Keep `status` commands non-blocking for discovery; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Add a mechanically checkable product-improvement entry point for menu item 5.
- Expand dashboard readiness output for menu items 1 through 6.
- Add tests for the renamed menu label, absence of the old learner-facing label, missing-prerequisite failure paths, unchanged existing 7-day/14-day behavior, and preservation of existing Free Development, Team Development, external-integration, dashboard, and product-gate checks.

## Verification Status

Required lesson-side verification target:

```text
7-day lesson CLI tests passed.
Lesson14 CLI tests passed.
Lesson repository test passed.
```

Latest local verification reached this target after synchronizing the 7-day parity implementation and the expanded language-list implementation.
The latest verification target now also includes `Menu prerequisite tests passed.`
The latest verification target now also includes `Product repository cleanup tests passed.`
The latest verification target now also includes `As-built sync contract tests passed.`
The latest verification target now also includes `Git workflow policy tests passed.`
The latest verification sequence includes `./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `./tools/as-built-sync status`, `./tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, and `./tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh`.
Real product operations testing remains available through `tools/test_production_operations.sh` when an external product repository is intentionally recreated.

## Remaining Work

- Commit and push only after all local checks pass.
- Translate remaining learner-facing Markdown files to English using the audit output from `tools/list_non_english_docs.sh`.
