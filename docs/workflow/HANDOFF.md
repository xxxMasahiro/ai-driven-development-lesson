## Current State

The lesson repository is in an implemented as-built sync-contract state with implemented Git workflow policy settings and implemented menu-wide Git workflow policy controls.
The current validation scope is lesson-side only; it must not recreate or depend on `task-tracker-repository`.
Existing 7-day lessons, 14-step lessons, free-development flow, advanced modules, checks, and repository-boundary behavior must not be weakened or replaced.
The implementation adds `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv`, `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `tools/as-built-sync`, `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv`, `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv`, `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh`, `tools/git-workflow`, and `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh`; it also extends `tools/menu`, `tools/dashboard`, and `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` for menu-wide Git policy controls while preserving product repository cleanup, shared menu prerequisite control for menu items 1 through 6, refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusable design, generality, and the no-existing-feature-tradeoff rule.
The implemented Git workflow policy now applies at menu level for items 1 through 7 and preserves all existing Git sync, CI, menu, dashboard, cleanup, lesson, and as-built synchronization behavior.
The current implemented Git workflow action settings separate Git workflow actions into detailed controls for commit, push, PR creation, PR CI monitoring, merge execution, developer-responsibility auto-merge, main CI monitoring, and local/remote sync monitoring while preserving existing broad Git settings and menu-wide Git policy behavior.
The current implemented Git hooks policy provides faster safe serial pre-commit behavior with `full`, `fast`, and `minimal` modes, conservative Git-local caching, and a path-based recommendation for when local full/no-cache should be run before push.
The current implemented resource-budgeted parallel guard captures the developer-approved implementation proposal for safe optional parallel execution based on user-configured memory and swap budgets; runtime policy, settings, CLI, Git hooks integration, Playwright worker recommendation, CI wiring, and tests are present.
The current planned learner context foundation adds source documents under `learning/context/` for the next lesson-content implementation cycle; it does not yet change runtime lesson output.
The current planned learner context runtime integration separates learning context from workflow context; Free Development Mode must remain a workflow and must not be implemented as a lesson.
The current implemented Security guard backfill adds repository-level security invariants, `docs/workflow/SAFEFLOW_SECURITY_BACKFILL.tsv`, `tools/check_security_invariants.sh`, and `tools/test_security_invariants.sh`.
The current implemented product security workflow gate adds `docs/workflow/PRODUCT_SECURITY_POLICY.tsv`, `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`, `tools/product-security`, `tools/test_product_security.sh`, and gate wiring for menu items 4, 5, and 6.
The current implemented test and CI safe time optimization first phase is documented as `test_ci_safe_time_optimization_plan`; it provides observe-only planning, fail-closed coverage validation, result attestation, CI-safe Git hooks parallelism, and lightweight fixture copying while preserving full/no-cache verification.
The current implemented CI timing and approved auto-improvement cycle is documented as `ci_timing_auto_improvement_plan`; it records measured final common aggregate/full-hooks timing, provides precise CI status targeting, and generates proposal-only CI improvement candidates while keeping future full/no-cache policy refinement developer-approved.
The current implemented CI aggregate and full-hooks split is documented as `ci_aggregate_full_hooks_split`; it runs main `CI` lesson aggregate and full/no-cache Git hook verification as separate jobs with a strict final gate while preserving cache policy and full/no-cache semantics.
The current implemented dashboard control center data layer is documented as `dashboard_control_center_data_layer`; it provides a read-only JSON source behind an AI-driven development control center while preserving the existing CLI dashboard.
The current implemented dashboard control center React UI is documented as `dashboard_control_center_react_ui_plan`; it provides a read-only browser control-center scope with maintained entry tooling, standalone/aggregate browser checks, and no UI action execution.
The current implemented dashboard control center information architecture is documented as `dashboard_control_center_information_architecture`; it provides category navigation, Overview-first presentation, `en`/`ja` fixed-label localization, snapshot freshness display, and Safety Actions command-preview isolation while preserving read-only behavior.
The current implemented dashboard control center visual polish is documented as `dashboard_control_center_visual_polish`; that layer brings the categorized read-only UI closer to `dashboard-control-center/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` without itself adding automatic refresh, live CI/Git authority, or UI command execution.
The current implemented dashboard control center mock parity is documented as `dashboard_control_center_mock_parity`; it brings the Overview structure closer to `mock-categorized-dashboard.png` with producer-owned metrics, compact issue preview expansion, central percentage rings, and Explore Pages metrics without fixed mock values.
The latest implemented dashboard control center live snapshot sync is documented as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`; it adds atomic schema-validated snapshot publication plus read-only browser polling and last-known-good behavior without browser command execution or live CI/Git authority.
The current implemented dashboard control center mock-aligned Overview is documented as `dashboard_control_center_mock_aligned_overview`; it keeps the Overview closer to the mock, makes empty Partial Failures explicit, separates manual follow-ups, avoids layout-changing Overview expansion, and preserves the read-only browser boundary.
The current implemented dashboard control center detail-page mock parity follow-up is documented as `dashboard_control_center_detail_mock_parity`; it uses the four approved detail mock images as UI/UX source references to make category pages explain what they check, what judgment they support, and what must be reviewed next while preserving the read-only browser boundary.

## Next Step

The resource-budgeted parallel guard is implemented.
The resource guard safe cleanup follow-up is implemented.
The resource guard summary and local/CI parallelization improvement is implemented as `resource_guard_summary_parallel_ci`.
The Security guard backfill is implemented as `safeflow_security_backfill`.
The product security workflow gate is implemented as `product_security_workflow_gate`.
The test and CI safe time optimization first phase is implemented as `test_ci_safe_time_optimization_plan`.
The latest implemented test/CI cycle is `test_ci_final_gate_optimization_plan`; local verification and remote synchronization passed for that cycle.
The latest implemented full-pipeline test/CI acceleration cycle is `test_ci_full_pipeline_acceleration_plan`.
The latest implemented CI timing and approved auto-improvement cycle is `ci_timing_auto_improvement_plan`.
The latest implemented CI split cycle is `ci_aggregate_full_hooks_split`; it is limited to main `CI` job scheduling and same-run evidence handoff.
The latest implemented dashboard/control-center cycle is `dashboard_control_center_mock_aligned_overview`, following `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`; together they provide data-backed mock parity, seamless read-only snapshot refresh, stable Overview summaries, and no UI action execution.
If future test/CI acceleration work is resumed, inspect Git state, confirm the sync contract is clean, preserve required workflow contexts, and implement only developer-approved candidates generated from `ci_timing_auto_improvement_plan` evidence.
If future dashboard control-center work is resumed, inspect Git state, confirm the sync contract is clean, keep existing `tools/dashboard` semantics, preserve `tools/dashboard-data` as read-only, and request developer approval before broad localization, live authoritative CI/Git/network status, browser-triggered checks, or any command execution.
Do not perform `.wslconfig` writes, swap creation/deletion, privileged cleanup, arbitrary process killing, CI weakening, pre-commit weakening, or Git hooks mode semantic changes without developer approval.
If resource guard behavior is changed later, preserve policy/settings-driven implementation, user-configurable available-memory floor, active-heavy-process fallback, explicit parallel-mode safe-stop, unknown-profile rejection, safe-stop failure for checks and job recommendations, standalone and aggregate tests, CI/pre-commit wiring, Playwright wrapper wiring, and existing Git hooks mode semantics.
If cleanup behavior is changed later, preserve dry-run by default, explicit `--safe` deletion, repo-local path validation, symlink escape rejection, marked Git hooks cache validation, fixture-based tests, CI/pre-commit wiring, and the prohibition on OS cache, swap, Docker, process, product repository, and global cache cleanup without developer approval.
If `resource_guard_summary_parallel_ci` is changed later, preserve existing `status`, `monitor`, `recommend-jobs`, `check`, `cleanup`, Git hooks mode semantics, pre-commit behavior, and CI check coverage.
Use resource guard recommendations for local Git hooks worker limits, but optimize GitHub Actions through CI-runner-oriented job splitting rather than applying local WSL memory settings to CI.
Treat unclassified Git hook checks as serial until they are explicitly classified as parallel-safe.
Keep per-check logs separated and replayed in deterministic definition order.
The implementation must add required CI workflow structure verification for job names, `needs`, and required command coverage.
The main CI split jobs that run aggregate repository tests or full hooks must install npm dependencies and Playwright dependencies before those checks run.
CI full-hooks execution must keep the CI-safe local-resource bypass behavior such as `RESOURCE_GUARD_SKIP_LOCAL_CHECK=1` or an equivalent documented mechanism, while local Playwright and Git hooks may use resource guard recommendations.
The `resource_guard_summary_parallel_ci` sync contract is implemented with actual runtime artifacts, runtime tests, and runtime evidence.
Developer approval is required before changing `GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` columns, changing the meaning of `full`, `fast`, or `minimal`, making Playwright or aggregate checks more aggressive than resource guard recommends, reducing CI coverage for speed, or adding a CI-specific settings file.
For future Security guard/product-security refinement, developer approval is required before expanding `AGENTS.MD` invariant wording, expanding blocking conditions that stop learner or workflow progress, adding network-dependent audits, changing external-integration approval prompts, or adding destructive cleanup behavior.
The `safeflow_security_backfill` and `product_security_workflow_gate` sync contracts are implemented with actual runtime artifacts, runtime tests, and runtime evidence.
For future `test_ci_safe_time_optimization_plan` refinement, keep changed-only selection observe-only until Coverage Guard and Result Attestation have enough full-CI evidence and developer approval. Do not reduce full/no-cache coverage, required CI checks, Playwright coverage, as-built sync enforcement, security checks, product-security checks, pre-commit behavior, or Git hooks mode semantics without developer approval.
For future `ci_timing_auto_improvement_plan` refinement, generated CI improvement candidates must remain read-only proposals until the developer approves implementation. Do not remove duplicate checks, reduce full/no-cache scope, or change workflow/job names without explicit developer approval.

Implemented Git workflow policy scope:

- Added `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` for supported Git workflow policy definitions.
- Added `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` for current user-selected Git workflow settings.
- Added `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` for shared setting loading, validation, permission checks, automation-level helpers, repository-context detection, and Git monitoring.
- Added `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan`.
- Let users allow or disallow normal working branches.
- Let users allow or disallow `git worktree`.
- Let users explicitly control whether direct work on `main` is allowed.
- Define automation levels:
  - `manual`: guidance only.
  - `commit`: commit may be automated after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks may be automated.
  - `sync`: main CI plus local/remote synchronization checks may be automated.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive operations behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Monitor uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local/remote divergence, unnecessary working branches, unnecessary worktrees, and whether the current repository is the lesson, product, or a custom repository.
- Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.
- Keep cleanup planning non-destructive.
- Reuse existing repository-boundary, Git sync, menu prerequisite, dashboard, and aggregate-test patterns.
- Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` for settings validation, permission decisions, automation-level decisions, dirty-state detection, local/remote sync monitoring, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- Wired validation into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, pre-commit, and as-built sync-contract behavior.
- The as-built sync contract records below include `git_workflow_policy` as implemented work.

The synchronized as-built sync-contract implementation is now represented across the three design/as-built documents and two workflow-state documents.

Implemented as-built sync-contract scope:

- Added `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` as the contract source for synchronized improvement IDs.
- Record each synchronized improvement with `sync_id`, `status`, `title`, `required_artifacts`, `required_tests`, `required_docs`, and `runtime_evidence`.
- Added matching `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks to all five synchronized documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
- Added `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Fail when a contract sync ID is missing from any of the five documents.
- Fail when any of the five documents contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- Fail when the same sync ID is marked `planned` in one document and `implemented` in another.
- Fail when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- Fail when required artifacts or required tests are missing from the repository.
- Fail when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- Fail when an implemented sync ID's required tests are not actively wired into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Keep `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh` and its topic-based checks active.
- Call `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` from `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Keep `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` active for the `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` pair.
- Added `tools/as-built-sync status` to show sync IDs, document coverage, artifact presence, and test wiring.
- Added `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
- Test complete synchronization, missing document block, unknown sync ID, mixed status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifact, inert wiring, and missing active test-wiring failure paths.
- Added `AGENTS.MD` routing and standard-check references for sync-contract status and validation.
- Wired the validator and regression test into `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, docs-tour, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

Planned learner context foundation scope:

- Added `learning/context/README.md` for context-document organization and synchronization boundaries.
- Added `learning/context/AI_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT_FOUNDATION.md` for the main learner-facing conceptual source text.
- Added `learning/context/SECURITY_FOUNDATION.md` for staged security learning.
- Added `learning/context/LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` so future implementation can map context topics to lesson phases.
- Updated `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md` so learners and agents can find the context source documents.
- Synchronized the planned state through `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` and the five synchronized documents.
- Runtime integration remains the next step and must not be assumed complete.

Planned learner context runtime integration scope:

- Sync ID: `learner_context_runtime_integration`.
- Status: `planned`.
- Keep 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, and applied modules as learning contexts.
- Keep Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson repository maintenance as workflow contexts.
- Planned future files include `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`, `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`, `tools/lesson-context`, and `tools/test_lesson_context.sh`.
- Planned future integration points include `tools/lesson`, `tools/lesson14`, `tools/team-development`, `tools/free-development`, `tools/product-improvement`, `tools/external-integration`, `tools/menu`, and `tools/dashboard`.
- Future implementation must preserve existing approval gates, ordered progression, learner-selected start positions, menu prerequisites, Git workflow settings, Git hooks settings, dashboard views, CI, pre-commit, and repository-boundary behavior.
- Future implementation must add standalone and aggregate test coverage before moving the sync ID to `implemented`.

Implemented Security guard backfill scope:

- Sync ID: `safeflow_security_backfill`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Runtime artifacts include `AGENTS.MD`, `docs/workflow/SAFEFLOW_SECURITY_BACKFILL.tsv`, `tools/lib/security_invariants.sh`, `tools/check_security_invariants.sh`, and `tools/test_security_invariants.sh`.
- The implementation adds mechanical security invariants without replacing existing learner context, 7-day lessons, 14-day lessons, CI, pre-commit, Git hooks, resource guard, as-built sync, or document-route behavior.
- The implementation does not mutate OS, WSL, Docker, cgroups, swap, or processes.

Implemented product security workflow gate scope:

- Sync ID: `product_security_workflow_gate`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Runtime artifacts include `docs/workflow/PRODUCT_SECURITY_POLICY.tsv`, `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`, `tools/lib/product_security.sh`, `tools/product-security`, and `tools/test_product_security.sh`.
- The implementation supports menu items 4, 5, and 6 as workflow contexts, not lessons.
- The implementation adds a stack-agnostic product-security command surface that can advise, check, and gate work without scanning outside the configured product repository.
- The implementation distinguishes advisory warnings from high-confidence blocking conditions and avoids exposing secret values in output or test fixtures.
- The implementation preserves explicit approval for external API/OAuth/webhook/secrets work and does not weaken existing product-repository boundaries, Git workflow policy, or cleanup behavior.

Implemented test and CI safe time optimization first-phase scope:

- Sync ID: `test_ci_safe_time_optimization_plan`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: reduce local and remote verification time by first adding the controls needed to remove duplicate work safely, then applying proven reductions without reducing safety or correctness.
- The first implementation adds Test Plan Manifest, learner-readable decision reasons, Coverage Guard, Result Attestation, CI-safe full-hooks parallelism, and lightweight fixture copying before any changed-only CI skipping or same-run evidence reuse is allowed.
- Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` as a standalone exhaustive command.
- Repeated as-built validation, duplicate Playwright execution, and duplicate final CI verification remain future optimization targets.
- A future full-hooks path may use a gap-only final gate only after a mechanical coverage check proves that individual hook rows plus the gap gate cover the standalone aggregate requirements.
- CI keeps full/no-cache verification authoritative while observe-only planning gathers evidence.
- CI may cache npm and Playwright dependencies, but not verification results.
- Developer approval is required before changed-only becomes authoritative in CI, required CI check names change, full/no-cache scope is reduced, flaky quarantine is introduced, or `full`, `fast`, and `minimal` semantics change.

Planned test and CI final gate optimization handoff:

- Sync ID: `test_ci_final_gate_optimization_plan`.
- Status: `implemented`; local verification passed, and remote `CI` / `Lesson14 CI` remain the external completion gates for the pushed commit.
- The implementation completes the test/CI optimization work by addressing the current `aggregate-and-full-hooks` bottleneck.
- The previous CI bottleneck was the final full/no-cache gate, especially duplicate `test_lesson_repository.sh`, duplicate Playwright execution, repeated as-built/sync checks, and duplicated common final verification between `CI` and `Lesson14 CI`.
- Same-run evidence is implemented before duplicate execution is removed.
- Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` available as the standalone exhaustive command.
- The full hook duplicate aggregate rerun is replaced only with a mechanically verified gap-only final gate.
- Playwright evidence is reused only when commit SHA, workflow run, source job identity, Playwright config hash, test file hashes, lockfile hash, command identity, repository-state hash, and success status match.
- `docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_COVERAGE.tsv` maps aggregate requirements to hook evidence or explicit final-gap commands; missing coverage must fail closed.
- `Lesson14 CI` uses a Lesson14-specific final gate instead of duplicating the common aggregate/full-hooks final gate from `CI`.
- `Lesson14 CI` preserves the legacy `playwright-tests` and `aggregate-and-full-hooks` job contexts as lightweight compatibility gates; they must not rerun browser tests, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, or `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`.
- `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` recommends local `full --no-cache` verification for final-gate coverage, final-gate command, CI evidence, and as-built evidence implementation changes.
- As-built/sync evidence is reused only when synchronized document hashes, sync-contract hash, checker hashes, command identity, repository-state hash, and success status match.
- npm and Playwright dependency caching are added, but verification results are not persistently cached across commits or workflow runs.
- Cleanup coverage includes same-run evidence, Playwright reports, test results, temporary fixtures, and repo-local caches.
- Preserve existing required workflow names unless developer approval is granted to change them.
- Stop for developer approval before accepting any existing-feature tradeoff, changing required CI names, reducing full/no-cache scope, making changed-only CI authoritative, introducing flaky quarantine, or reusing verification results across workflow runs.
- Required first implementation step: add focused tests for gap-only coverage and same-run evidence rejection before changing CI execution flow.

Implemented test and CI full pipeline acceleration handoff:

- Sync ID: `test_ci_full_pipeline_acceleration_plan`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: complete the remaining local and remote test/CI acceleration work without reducing required coverage, safety, or compatibility.
- GitHub Actions deprecation regression guards are implemented in CI workflow structure checks.
- Playwright setup uses `tools/ci-playwright-setup` for cache-aware dependency and Chromium setup with normal fallback installs.
- Safe full-hook parallel expansion is policy-driven through `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`.
- Duplicated policy-regression work between `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` is reduced while preserving required compatibility contexts.
- `tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh` verifies the acceleration contract as a standalone and aggregate-callable check.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` recognizes the Lesson14 compatibility split only when main `CI` keeps active coverage for the relevant test.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` uses process-local wiring lookup caching only; do not convert that into persistent verification-result cache without developer approval.
- Keep changed-only CI observe-only until Coverage Guard, Result Attestation, full-CI comparison evidence, and developer approval allow any authoritative behavior.
- Preserve existing Step 1-7, Step 1-14, applied lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, Security guard checks, product-security, docs-tour, as-built sync, pre-commit, local full/no-cache, and remote CI behavior.
- Do not add future tool names to the sync contract until those files exist and are testable.
- Stop for developer approval before changing required CI workflow or job names, reducing full/no-cache scope, caching verification results across runs, introducing flaky quarantine, making changed-only CI authoritative, or accepting any existing-feature tradeoff.
- Recovery: if cache, parallelization, evidence reuse, or job splitting weakens determinism or coverage, revert that specific optimization path and keep the strict existing check.

CI timing and approved auto-improvement handoff:

- Sync ID: `ci_timing_auto_improvement_plan`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: make further final common aggregate/full-hooks shortening evidence-driven by recording per-check timing, generating read-only improvement proposals, and requiring developer approval before implementing generated candidates.
- Runtime behavior now includes `tools/ci-timing`, `tools/lib/ci_timing.sh`, `tools/test_ci_timing.sh`, strict `check_ci_status.sh` workflow/job matching, and main `CI` timing artifacts for final common aggregate/full-hooks checks.
- The main `CI` workflow records timing for `Lesson aggregate test` and `Git hooks full no-cache regression`, then uploads `ci-timing-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}`.
- `tools/ci-timing propose` is read-only and reports slow checks, same-run evidence candidates, and parallelization candidates with developer-approval requirements.
- `tools/check_ci_status.sh --required` requires both `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` when run from this lesson repository without an explicit workflow; product or custom repositories keep the narrower single-workflow behavior.
- Same-run hash evidence reuse may be implemented only when command identity, input hashes, policy hashes, repository-state hash, workflow/run identity, and success status match.
- Full hook parallel-group refinement should happen only after timing evidence identifies remaining bottlenecks and the grouping stays policy-driven.
- Conditional `full no-cache` scope reduction remains a later developer-approved operation.
- Preserve existing Step 1-7, Step 1-14, applied lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, Security guard checks, product-security checks, docs-tour, as-built sync, pre-commit, local full/no-cache, and remote CI behavior.
- Do not implement generated CI improvement candidates without developer approval.
- Recovery: if timing, proposal generation, evidence reuse, or status targeting weakens determinism or coverage, restore strict existing checks and keep the candidate proposal-only.

CI aggregate and full-hooks split handoff:

- Sync ID: `ci_aggregate_full_hooks_split`.
- Status: `implemented`; local verification, sub-agent review, commit, push, required remote `CI` and `Lesson14 CI`, and local/remote sync passed.
- Purpose: shorten the main `CI` wall time by running lesson aggregate verification and full/no-cache Git hook verification as separate jobs, then requiring a strict final gate.
- Scope: main `CI` final common verification only. `Lesson14 CI` compatibility contexts remain unchanged.
- The implementation intentionally does not add persistent verification-result cache, conditional full/no-cache skipping, changed-only authoritative CI, Git hook group matrix splitting, or flaky quarantine.
- `lesson-aggregate` runs `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh --use-evidence --write-evidence` after the same prerequisite gates and same-run Playwright evidence download.
- `git-hooks-full-no-cache` runs `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache --jobs 4` after the same prerequisite gates and uploads same-run Git hook evidence.
- `final-gate` depends on both split jobs, starts with `if: ${{ always() }}`, validates split prerequisite results, requires the same-run Git hook evidence artifact from `git-hooks-full-no-cache`, runs `tools/ci-final-gate`, merges non-colliding timing-part report files, and uploads the final timing report artifact.
- `tools/ci-timing` keeps `CI_TIMING_REPORT` scoped to the wrapper report path and unsets it for wrapped commands so nested timing checks do not overwrite parent job reports.
- `tools/lib/ci_evidence.sh` keeps same-run evidence filenames safe for GitHub artifact upload while preserving original evidence ids in metadata.
- `Lesson14 CI` uses `CI_COMMON_COVERAGE_SOURCE: ci-split-common-coverage` as the stable compatibility marker for common split coverage.
- `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh` and `tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh` are the focused guards for the split and must remain standalone-callable and aggregate-callable.
- Preserve existing Step 1-7, Step 1-14, applied lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, Security guard, product-security, docs-tour, as-built sync, pre-commit, local full/no-cache, and remote CI behavior.
- Recovery: if evidence handoff, timing merge, required contexts, or coverage fails, restore strict combined behavior or fail closed before reporting PASS.
- Developer approval is required before changing required workflow contexts beyond this approved split, reducing full/no-cache coverage, adding persistent cache semantics, making changed-only CI authoritative, splitting full hooks into a group matrix, or accepting any existing-feature tradeoff.

Dashboard control center data layer handoff:

- Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_data_layer`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: provide a stable, read-only JSON data layer for a future AI-driven development control center before adding React/Vite or any browser UI.
- Current artifacts: `tools/lib/dashboard_data.sh`, `tools/dashboard-data`, and `docs/workflow/DASHBOARD_DATA_SCHEMA.tsv` provide the runtime JSON producer, reusable helpers, and implemented field contract.
- Current schema guard: `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh` checks status separation, required schema paths, concise guidance fields, partial-failure fields, command-preview fields, and non-executable preview boundaries.
- Current data guard: `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh` checks JSON syntax, schema version, source files, concise guidance items, completed-lesson representation, allowed status vocabulary, partial failures, policy/gate separation, command-preview safety, and secret-like data redaction.
- Existing `tools/dashboard` remains the human-readable CLI dashboard and must not be parsed by a browser as the data contract.
- Future React/Vite mechanics must stay behind the dashboard control-center surface; ordinary users should not need to see Vite commands, dev-server URLs, package scripts, or frontend internals.
- Future non-engineer UX should require one ordinary user action only: open the dashboard/control center through the provided entry point while maintained tooling handles setup, Vite startup, URL selection, JSON loading, and checks.
- Future UI work should preserve a dual-audience control panel: lesson content/progress/management must be clear for non-engineers, and workflow content/progress/management, gates, evidence, blockers, approvals, and next operational actions must remain precise enough for intermediate and senior engineers.
- Future UI work must preserve the repository's two first-class surfaces, lessons and workflows, as distinct but coordinated control-panel areas that are easy to scan, understand, and operate.
- Keep the JSON producer read-only and source-of-truth preserving: use existing CLI, TSV, Markdown, policy files, and shared helpers instead of duplicating Security guard, Git workflow, Resource guard, CI, or lesson logic in React.
- Separate policy readiness, settings readiness, gate passage, approvals, optional evidence, cached evidence, and unknown state.
- The first UI phase must be read-first, explain-first, and approve-before-action; do not execute push, PR creation, merge, cleanup, deletion, external integration, OAuth/API, or other dangerous operations.
- Focused tests are standalone-callable and aggregate-callable and must not depend on a specific product stack, current prose wording, network availability, or live GitHub state.
- Recovery: if dashboard-data work later weakens existing dashboard, lesson, Security guard, Git workflow, CI, pre-commit, or as-built behavior, restore strict existing behavior and keep the dashboard-data work behind the implemented contract.
- Developer approval is required before choosing `tools/dashboard --format json`, adding React/Vite dependencies, exposing any Vite-specific user workflow, adding command execution buttons, making live network status authoritative, or changing existing dashboard semantics. If an existing-feature tradeoff appears necessary, stop and redesign; accepting the tradeoff is not allowed.

Dashboard control center React UI plan handoff:

- Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_react_ui_plan`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: provide a read-only React/Vite browser control center that consumes the implemented dashboard JSON data layer without changing existing CLI dashboard behavior.
- Current boundary: this implementation adds approved dependencies, package scripts, browser runtime files, maintained entry tooling, and browser test wiring; it does not add UI action execution or make frontend-only state authoritative.
- User path: ordinary users should have one dashboard/control-center entry action; maintained tooling handles Vite startup, URL selection, JSON loading, and check orchestration.
- UI model: keep lessons and workflows distinct. Lessons show plain-language content, progress, structured points, warnings, and next learning action from dashboard JSON. Workflows show practical gate, evidence, blocker, approval, Git/CI sync, and next operational action detail for engineers.
- Data source: consume `tools/dashboard-data` output and `docs/workflow/DASHBOARD_DATA_SCHEMA.tsv`; do not parse `tools/dashboard` prose.
- Contract gap handling: lesson points, warnings, and next learning actions are now structured dashboard JSON fields; do not synthesize future fields from CLI prose.
- Safety: keep command previews read-only, treat untrusted text as data, avoid secrets/raw logs/external payloads, and do not make frontend-only state authoritative for safety decisions.
- Required future approval: action execution, live authoritative network status, and any `tools/dashboard` semantic change require developer approval.
- Recovery: if future UI work weakens existing lessons, workflows, Security guard, Resource guard, Git workflow, CI, pre-commit, as-built sync, docs, or dashboard data boundaries, restore existing behavior and redesign. Existing-feature tradeoffs are not allowed.

Dashboard control center information architecture handoff:

- Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_information_architecture`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: make the browser dashboard easier to scan by splitting the read-only control center into Overview, Lessons, Development Workflow, Maintenance Sync, and Safety Actions.
- Design reference: `dashboard-control-center/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` is a mock reference for information architecture, not a pixel-perfect runtime requirement.
- Current UI: Overview is the default; it shows snapshot mode, generated time, relative age, read-only state, blocker count, next safe action, guidance, partial failures, warnings, and category-health cards.
- Category boundary: Lessons, Development Workflow, Maintenance Sync, and Safety Actions are separate views so lesson state, workflow state, maintenance sync, and safety/action-preview content are not mixed.
- Localization boundary: fixed UI labels support `en` and `ja` from the device language with English fallback; commands, file paths, gate IDs, source names, and dashboard JSON prose are not browser-translated.
- Freshness boundary: generated time and relative age are display context only; they do not make stale/live status authoritative.
- Safety boundary: command previews remain preview-only and non-executable; no command-execution buttons were added.
- Tests: `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh` now covers category navigation, Overview-first behavior, Safety Actions isolation, absence of command-execution controls, secret-like redaction, mobile layout, and `en`/`ja` fixed-label localization.
- Deferred phases: UI-triggered command execution, live authoritative CI/Git status, data-schema localization fields, and broad language coverage require separate specification, synchronization, approval, and tests. Read-only live snapshot refresh is implemented later as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`.
- Recovery: if future dashboard work hides safety details, translates operational data text, weakens `tools/dashboard-data`, or changes existing CLI/lesson/check behavior, restore the implemented read-only category boundary and redesign. Existing-feature tradeoffs are not allowed.

Dashboard control center visual polish handoff:

- Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_visual_polish`.
- Status: `implemented`.
- Purpose: make the categorized read-only dashboard visually closer to `dashboard-control-center/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` while preserving the implemented data and safety boundaries.
- Design reference: the mock guides layout density, hierarchy, segmented status, sidebar context, compact health cards, and category shortcuts; it remains a visual reference, not a pixel-perfect runtime contract.
- Current UI: Overview keeps the snapshot context prominent, uses a segmented operational status strip, lays category-health cards out as a compact desktop grid, provides Explore Pages shortcuts, and shows read-only/last-updated context in the sidebar.
- Localization boundary: fixed UI labels remain `en`/`ja` with English fallback; commands, file paths, source names, status text from dashboard JSON, and other operational data remain data text.
- Safety boundary: visual shortcuts are navigation links only. They must not become command-execution controls without a separate specification, synchronization, approval, and tests.
- Tests: `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh` covers the visual structure through Playwright without relying on pixel-perfect screenshot matching.
- Follow-up boundary: automatic read-only snapshot refresh is implemented later as `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`; UI-triggered checks, live authoritative CI/Git integration, command execution, new dependencies, and broad localization remain separate future phases.
- Recovery: if future dashboard visual work weakens the CLI dashboard, `tools/dashboard-data`, category isolation, Safety Actions preview-only behavior, mobile layout, existing lessons, checks, CI, or pre-commit, restore the implemented boundary and redesign. Existing-feature tradeoffs are not allowed.

The previously synchronized menu-wide implementation is `menu_git_workflow_policy`.
It promotes the existing Git workflow policy into a shared menu-level policy without weakening any existing lesson, menu, dashboard, cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built synchronization behavior.

Implemented menu-wide Git workflow policy scope:

- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the existing policy source.
- Make `tools/menu readiness` show Git policy readiness for menu items 1 through 7.
- Added Git policy validation to `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` without weakening existing learning-mode, language, product-language, repository-boundary, or approval checks.
- Added `tools/menu check 7` and `tools/menu start 7 --confirm` for lesson-repository maintenance.
- Keep `automation_level=manual` valid and non-blocking.
- Interpret automation levels consistently across learning, building/extending, and maintenance menu categories.
  - `manual`: guidance and monitoring only.
  - `commit`: commit-level automation only after required checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR, and CI-check automation where applicable.
  - `sync`: main synchronization plus local/remote sync checks where applicable.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository cleanup behind explicit confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Show menu-wide Git policy status in dashboard output.
- Added runtime tests in `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` and updated these five synchronized documents from planned to implemented.

Implemented Git workflow action settings scope:

- Keep `branch_allowed`, `worktree_allowed`, `main_direct_work_allowed`, and `automation_level`.
- Treat `automation_level` as a compatibility preset.
- Detailed settings take precedence only when the detailed setting key is present.
- Fall back to `automation_level` when a detailed setting key is absent so current implemented behavior is preserved.
- Add detailed settings for:
  - `commit_automation: manual|auto`
  - `push_automation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_creation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `merge_execution: manual|after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false|true`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: manual|auto`
- Use safety-oriented defaults:
  - `commit_automation: auto`
  - `push_automation: manual`
  - `pr_creation: manual`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `merge_execution: after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: auto`
- These detailed defaults are active after implementation; `automation_level` remains available as a compatibility preset when detailed action keys are absent.
- Add a shared `git_workflow_action_mode <action>` resolver for `commit`, `push`, `pr`, `ci`, `pr_ci`, `merge`, `main_ci`, and `sync`.
- Keep `ci` as a compatibility alias for CI monitoring so existing `tools/git-workflow allow ci` behavior is preserved.
- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set` as the user-facing setting surface.
- Show detailed action settings in `tools/menu readiness` and `tools/dashboard menu`.
- Apply the same detailed settings to menu items 1 through 7.
- For push and PR creation, `auto` means the agent may execute the operation only after explicit approval for that operation is recorded; it never means approval-free execution.
- `merge_execution: after_approval` means the agent may execute merge only after explicit merge approval is recorded.
- `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_APPROVALS.tsv` stores matching action, repository, and branch approval receipts for detailed push, PR creation, and normal merge execution.
- `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` is the only implemented path for developer-responsibility approval-free merge and requires PR CI success, clear target PR and branch, verified merge base, clean working tree, checked local/remote state, and stop-on-failure behavior.
- Developer-responsibility auto-merge requires gate evidence plus actual repository checks; the setting alone does not permit approval-free merge.
- Keep branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository deletion behind explicit user confirmation regardless of merge settings.
- Moved `git_workflow_action_settings` from `planned` to `implemented` across the sync contract and all five synchronized documents.

Implemented Git hooks policy handoff:

- Sync ID: `git_hooks_policy`.
- Current status: `implemented`.
- Current scope: faster safe serial pre-commit execution.
- Safety baseline: preserve the current `.githooks/pre-commit` behavior and existing CI/check coverage.
- Implemented modes:
  - `full`: current-equivalent required pre-commit coverage.
  - `fast`: cache-assisted execution only when prior successful inputs still match.
  - `minimal`: quick local mechanical checks, not final completion coverage.
- Local `minimal` remains valid for ordinary quick feedback; local `full --no-cache` is recommended when changed paths match Git hooks, CI, check, test, or as-built synchronization policy.
- Normal learner-facing `off` mode is out of scope.
- Cache location is Git-local and untracked, such as `.git/pre-commit-cache/`.
- Cache must fail closed: missing, stale, corrupted, or unverifiable entries force a run.
- Hook check configuration must fail closed when rows are malformed or contain invalid or empty mode tokens.
- The command surface includes hook status, local verification recommendation, mode selection, cache clearing, normal run, no-cache run, and explicit mode run.
- Implemented targets include `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/git-hooks`, `tools/lib/git_hooks_policy.sh`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`, `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv`, and `tools/test_git_hooks.sh`.
- Existing wiring checks and status output now recognize runner-based pre-commit dispatch while preserving direct-command detection.
- Required next action after this sync: run the as-built sync checks, related tests, aggregate test, `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`, and pre-commit. If they pass, the change is ready for developer review or commit.
- Developer approval is required before changing the minimal-mode required check list or skipping Playwright-related checks through cache beyond the implemented fail-closed behavior.
- Recovery path: clear the cache and rerun no-cache on suspected cache issues; restore the current serial pre-commit command list if runner integration fails.

The synchronized product repository cleanup implementation remains represented across the same documents.

Implemented product repository cleanup scope:

- Added `tools/product-repository-cleanup` so learners and agents can safely remove the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
- Support `status`, `plan`, `local`, and `remote` subcommands.
- Keep `status` and `plan` non-destructive.
- Require explicit confirmation for local cleanup with the configured product repository name, such as `task-tracker-repository`.
- Require explicit confirmation for remote cleanup with the full GitHub owner/repository name, such as `xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository`.
- Keep local deletion and remote deletion separate; do not add `all` or automatic chained deletion.
- Reject local deletion unless the target is the configured external product repository path, normally `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository`.
- Reject local deletion when the target is inside the lesson repository, does not match the configured product repository name, is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, is not the Git top level, or cannot be identified safely.
- Require GitHub authentication and a successful remote repository lookup before any remote deletion attempt.
- Show the remote URL and owner/repository name before any remote deletion.
- Print a clear operation log for status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths.
- Added `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
- Test status, plan, missing confirmation, wrong confirmation, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- Do not delete a real GitHub repository in lesson-repository tests.
- Wired the cleanup test into structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Exposed runtime discovery through README, AGENTS routing, menu item 5, and the dashboard development view.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

The synchronized menu prerequisite implementation remains represented across the same documents.

Implemented scope:

- Rename the learner-facing menu item to `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the Team Development and Docker path available through the renamed applied-learning item.
- Require learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context/boundary confirmation where relevant, and learner approval before starting menu items 1 through 6.
- Reuse existing 7-day and 14-day settings where available.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the most recently configured structured-lesson settings when possible; otherwise require missing settings before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for product-side work.
- Implement the prerequisite logic through shared reusable helpers rather than duplicated menu branches.
- Keep `status` commands non-blocking for discovery; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Add a mechanically checkable product-improvement entry point for menu item 5.
- Expand dashboard readiness output for menu items 1 through 6.
- Add tests for the renamed menu label, absence of the old learner-facing label, missing-prerequisite failure paths, unchanged existing 7-day/14-day behavior, and preservation of existing Free Development, Team Development, external-integration, dashboard, and product-gate checks.

Current implemented docs-map scope:

- Added `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md` so learners can understand the repository's document system before document-heavy work.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills in non-engineer-friendly terms.
- Distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.
- Explain `docs/as-built/`, `docs/workflow/`, and `docs/memory/` by role.
- Explain `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, and `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv` as Git hook policy and current local hook-mode controls.
- Explain `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md` and product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records without claiming a lesson-side failure-memory file exists.
- Added `tools/docs-tour status|rules|design|workflow|memory|skills|all` with learning-mode-aware A/B/C explanation depth.
- Added `./tools/dashboard docs` and included it in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Added copy-paste prompt examples for asking an agent to explain `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` and the as-built trio in learner-friendly language.
- Added early 7-day and 14-day guidance about why the documents exist.
- Added `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and wired it into the relevant structure, as-built, developer-memory, aggregate, CI, and pre-commit checks.
- Preserve existing lesson progression, approvals, checks, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, skills, memory workflow, and repository-boundary behavior.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- The validation suite must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

Implemented local verification passed the lesson-side verification sequence:

```bash
./tools/check_lesson_structure.sh
./tools/check_lesson14_structure.sh
./tools/check_lesson14_sync.sh
./tools/check_agents_skills.sh

```

The expected terminal evidence is:

```text
7-day lesson CLI tests passed.
Lesson14 CLI tests passed.
Lesson repository test passed.
Git hooks policy tests passed.
Git hooks checks passed: full mode
```

Run `tools/test_production_operations.sh` only when a product repository is intentionally present.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Mock Parity Handoff

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_mock_parity`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Current restart context:

- The existing React/Vite control center is implemented and read-only.
- `dashboard-control-center/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` is the current visual reference.
- The real UI now has data-backed parity for compact Next Safe Action, Partial Failures preview, central percentage rings, and Explore Pages metrics.
- Do not regress by hard-coding mock values such as fixed percentages, fixed item counts, or fixture-specific text into the browser.
- Metrics must stay producer/schema-owned before display.
- Keep optional/unverified live checks separate from true failures by using manual follow-ups rather than `partial_failures`.
- Use normal and alternate valid fixtures so hard-coded percentages or counts fail in tests.
- Keep full issue details reachable through category pages as read-only navigation, not command-execution actions.
- Keep command previews isolated under Safety Actions and non-executable.

Implemented verification entry points:

1. `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh`.
2. `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh`.
3. `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
4. `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

Sync-contract note: keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, full/no-cache Git hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`, and `tools/ci-final-gate` as final verification/runtime evidence rather than `TESTS` field entries for this sync ID, because the as-built contract requires `TESTS` entries to be directly wired standalone checks.

Recovery path:

- If metrics cannot be derived safely, stop before UI implementation and request approval rather than inventing values.
- If optional statuses look like true Partial Failures, split the display and data fields.
- If mock parity conflicts with read-only safety, preserve safety and report the conflict.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Live Snapshot Sync Handoff

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_live_snapshot_sync`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Current restart context:

- The user approved and this implementation adds a staged path toward seamless live dashboard updates.
- The browser updates while open next to the dashboard CLI, but it remains read-only.
- `tools/dashboard-data` remains the JSON producer; `tools/dashboard` prose must not become a browser data source.
- `tools/dashboard-control-center open` is the right shell boundary for periodic snapshot publication.
- `tools/dashboard-data` must publish producer-owned `snapshot_id` and `content_hash`; browser change detection should use those fields.
- React should keep the last known good snapshot on failed or invalid refresh.
- Browser polling must be GET-only and must not call Git, GitHub, CI, shell, or `tools/*` command endpoints.

Implemented verification entry points:

1. `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh`.
2. `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh`.
3. `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
4. `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

Sync-contract note: keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, full/no-cache Git hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`, and `tools/ci-final-gate` as final verification/runtime evidence rather than `TESTS` field entries for this sync ID, because the as-built contract requires `TESTS` entries to be directly wired standalone checks.

Recovery path:

- If atomic snapshot publishing fails, keep the previous one-shot snapshot behavior and stop before enabling refresh.
- If polling blanks the UI on bad data, restore last-known-good behavior before continuing.
- If any browser execution path appears necessary, stop and request approval as a separate future sync ID.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Mock-Aligned Overview Handoff

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_mock_aligned_overview`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Current restart context:

- The browser control center is already read-only and has live snapshot sync.
- `dashboard-control-center/mock-categorized-dashboard.png` remains the visual reference.
- The implemented Overview removes visible non-mock header and snapshot explanation chrome while preserving an accessible page title.
- Next Safe Action keeps the label/helper outside the green primary action row, with target, expected result, and risk as white icon-led metadata rows.
- Partial Failures is always visible as a control-panel category; an empty list shows a concise none state.
- Manual follow-ups do not appear as true failures and are summarized in a separate row with detail navigation.
- The visible Category Health heading is removed; the accessible category-health region remains.
- The four health cards are height-aligned in the grid.
- The four health rings use distinct category colors for lessons, workflow, maintenance, and safety.
- Overview details do not rely on expansion that changes layout height; detailed lists belong on existing category pages.
- Icons added to navigation, status, repeated rows/cards, summaries, and details are decorative or accessible labels only; they must not become buttons or execution affordances.
- The bottom notice is concise repository-control-panel UI chrome.

Implemented verification entry points:

1. `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
2. `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
3. `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
4. `tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh`.
5. `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh`.
6. `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

Sync-contract note: keep full/no-cache Git hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and `tools/ci-final-gate` as final verification/runtime evidence rather than broadening this sync ID's `TESTS` field beyond directly wired standalone checks.

Recovery path:

- If removing the visible header breaks accessibility, restore a screen-reader-only title, not the large visible header.
- If manual follow-up navigation is unclear, keep the Overview summary but improve link labels before adding new disclosure behavior.
- If any command execution, non-GET fetch, or command preview leakage appears outside Safety Actions, remove it before continuing.
- If mobile overflow appears, fix responsive constraints rather than adding language-specific branches.

## Implemented Dashboard Control Center Detail-Page Mock Parity Handoff

Sync ID: `dashboard_control_center_detail_mock_parity`.
Current status: `implemented`.

Current restart context:

- The copied visual references are `dashboard-control-center/mock-detail-lessons.png`, `mock-detail-workflow.png`, `mock-detail-maintenance.png`, and `mock-detail-safety.png`.
- The detail-page mock images are the UI/UX source references for layout, information priority, colors, density, and icon direction; tests validate structure and safety, not pixel-perfect screenshot equality.
- Each detail page starts with a mock-aligned page header and decision summary: what the page checks, current judgment, must-review items, and the next safe check.
- Workflow category icons use one centralized branching `Network` icon component across Overview, navigation, Explore Pages, workflow detail header, and workflow category summary rows.
- Lessons detail surfaces missing settings, warnings, and next learning action in inspection panels before completed details; the primary warning label is derived from structured lesson status fields.
- Development Workflow detail prioritizes approval-required and unknown items in checklist rows, uses human-readable titles, and moves technical keys to secondary metadata.
- Maintenance Sync detail groups snapshot trust, manual follow-ups, warnings, and source boundaries as status cards, a confirmation table, and a source-boundary panel.
- Safety Actions detail separates status cards, Partial Failures table, and display-only Command Previews without adding execution affordances.
- Short localized risk/status labels such as `低` are visually centered.
- English remains the repository-standard data language; fixed UI labels and known control-center source/intent labels display through the resolved UI locale.
- The control-panel UI locale resolver is separate from user-selected lesson display language and workflow/product language settings.
- The browser remains read-only; no route may execute shell, Git, GitHub, CI, or `tools/*` commands.

Planned verification entry points:

1. `tools/test_dashboard_control_center.sh`.
2. `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
3. `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
4. `tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh`.
5. `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh`.
6. `tools/test_dashboard_schema.sh`.
7. `tools/test_dashboard_data.sh`.
8. `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

Sync-contract note: keep full/no-cache Git hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and `tools/ci-final-gate` as final verification/runtime evidence rather than broadening this sync ID's `TESTS` field beyond directly wired standalone checks.

Recovery path:

- If detail summaries contradict snapshot data, derive them from existing helper functions and translator labels before adding styling.
- If workflow icon replacement imports fail, use one centralized lucide branching-workflow icon that matches the approved mock direction.
- If mobile overflow appears, adjust responsive constraints instead of adding language-specific branches.
- If command previews look executable, strengthen display-only labels and remove any action-like affordance before continuing.
- If any existing-feature tradeoff appears necessary, stop and request developer approval.

## Implemented Lesson Display Label Policy Handoff

Implemented lesson display-label policy sync:

- Sync ID: `lesson_display_label_policy`.
- Current status: `implemented`.
- Current scope: separate learner-facing STEP course labels from internal compatibility names and historical records.
- Do not treat this as a global replacement task.
- Preserve `Step N/14` as the current Lesson14 sync-gate key unless a future approved implementation mechanically separates sync keys from display labels.
- Preserve `tools/lesson14`, `index-14-days.md`, `_14_DAYS` files, `dayN.*` step IDs, and existing historical learning records.
- Implemented learner-facing targets include menu, dashboard, lesson14 reset/runtime output, learn/helpdesk record labels, README, AGENTS routing text, index files, guides, prompts, playbooks, roadmap output, scenario text, and learner-display checks.
- Shared display labels live in `docs/workflow/LESSON_DISPLAY_LABELS.tsv`; shared shell resolution lives in `tools/lib/lesson_display_labels.sh`, with `tools/lib/lesson_common.sh` providing the reusable flow-step display label for record-writing commands.
- Current test caveat: if new learner-facing surfaces are added later, they must be added to `tools/check_learner_display.sh` or another active-surface test rather than relying on global replacement.
- Required verification after implementation: `git diff --check`, `./tools/check_learner_display.sh`, `./tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh`, `./tools/check_lesson14_sync.sh`, `./tools/test_lesson14.sh`, `./tools/check_agents_skills.sh`, `./tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh`, `./tools/as-built-sync status`, `./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Recovery path: if sync gates fail, restore the `Step N/14` machine-key contract first; if display checks over-match history, add a policy-governed allowlist rather than rewriting logs.
