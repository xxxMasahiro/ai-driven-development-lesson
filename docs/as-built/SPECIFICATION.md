## As-Built Components

### Lesson Control

- `tools/lesson` controls the 7-day lesson.
- `tools/lesson14` controls the 14-day lesson.
- `tools/lesson14 承認 <start|pass> <step_id> "memo"` records approval receipts.
- `tools/lesson 学習モード <A|B|C>` records and switches 7-day explanation depth.
- `tools/lesson 表示言語 <ja|en|ko|zh-CN|zh-TW|es|pt-BR|fr|de|id|vi|th|hi|ar>` records 7-day workflow display language.
- `tools/lesson 開発言語 <ja|en|ko|zh-CN|zh-TW|es|pt-BR|fr|de|id|vi|th|hi|ar>` records 7-day product development language.
- `tools/lesson14 学習モード <A|B|C>` records and switches explanation depth.
- `tools/lesson14 表示言語 <ja|en|ko|zh-CN|zh-TW|es|pt-BR|fr|de|id|vi|th|hi|ar>` records 14-day workflow display language.
- `tools/lesson14 開発言語 <ja|en|ko|zh-CN|zh-TW|es|pt-BR|fr|de|id|vi|th|hi|ar>` records 14-day product development language.
- `tools/lesson 開始位置 <step_id> --confirm` changes the 7-day start position intentionally.
- `tools/lesson14 開始位置 <step_id> --confirm` changes the 14-day start position intentionally.
- `tools/lesson14 初期化 --confirm` resets 14-day runtime state for a fresh run.
- English aliases are available for the same lesson controls where implemented, including `approve`, `learning-mode`, `start-at`, and `reset`.

### Learning Modes

- A: detailed explanation.
- B: brief supplemental explanation.
- C: workflow only.
- Mode can be changed during either structured lesson.
- 7-day `setup.index` cannot pass until learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- 14-day `setup.index` cannot pass until learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.

### Dialogue And Sub-Agent Learning

- `guides/LESSON_14_DAYS.md` defines dialogue and wall-bouncing with the agent as a core learning objective.
- `prompts/PROMPTS_14_DAYS.md` includes a wall-bouncing prompt.
- Step 12/14 teaches sub-agents as role-based viewpoints.
- The orchestrating agent must decide what to adopt, defer, or reject based on the learner's goal.

### Free Development Mode

- `free-development/FREE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE.md` defines optional post-lesson product development.
- `tools/free-development status` shows mode context.
- `tools/free-development start` prints the start prompt.
- `tools/free-development gate` checks product boundary, Git sync, and CI.
- Learners can choose languages, frameworks, databases, payment systems, hosting, testing tools, APIs, and integrations.

### Team Development And Docker

- `advanced/TEAM_DEVELOPMENT_DOCKER.md` defines the advanced module.
- `advanced/DOCKER_PATHS.md` separates the no-Docker and Docker-installed learning paths.
- `tools/team-development status` reports module status and Docker availability.
- `tools/team-development start` prints the start prompt.
- `tools/team-development gate` checks product boundary, Git sync, CI, and Docker availability when Docker is installed.
- Docker execution is optional unless Docker is available and the learner chooses container implementation.

### Menu And Dashboard

- `tools/menu` displays the approved learner-facing menu grouped by intent:
  - learning paths,
  - building and extending paths,
  - lesson-maintenance paths.
- The menu explicitly shows the progression from Free Development Mode to product improvement to external integration.
- `tools/dashboard lesson` shows 14-day lesson status, 7-day lesson status, both lesson language settings, learning mode labels, helpdesk information, and developer-memory themes.
- `tools/dashboard development` shows product repository status and workflow document presence when a product repository exists.
- `tools/dashboard illustrations` shows illustration request and review records.
- `tools/dashboard all` combines the lesson, development, and illustration views.

### Menu Prerequisite Control

Menu-control prerequisites are implemented without replacing or weakening any existing menu entry, lesson flow, dashboard view, product gate, or repository-boundary check.

- The learner-facing menu label is `3. 応用レッスン`.
- The renamed applied-learning item continues to route to the existing Team Development and Docker learning path.
- Menu items 1 through 6 share one prerequisite model:
  - learning mode,
  - workflow display language,
  - product development language,
  - repository context and boundary confirmation where relevant,
  - learner approval before start.
- 7-day and 14-day menu entries use their existing lesson setting files and setup gates.
- Applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration read a shared settings view that can inherit the latest configured structured-lesson settings.
- If the shared settings view cannot resolve learning mode, workflow display language, or product development language, start/gate/check commands instruct the learner to select the missing setting before proceeding.
- `status` commands remain non-blocking and available for orientation even when prerequisites are missing.
- Enforcement is implemented through reusable helper logic in `tools/lib/lesson_common.sh`, with composable menu prerequisite checks used by menu-specific tools.
- Product improvement has a mechanically checkable entry point: `tools/product-improvement status|start|gate`.
- Dashboard output exposes readiness for menu items 1 through 6 and does not hide existing dashboard information.
- Tests validate the renamed menu label, absence of the old label in learner-facing menu output, missing-prerequisite failure paths for missing settings, and unchanged 7-day/14-day behavior.

### Implemented Documentation Map And Tour

The documentation-map improvement is implemented in the current runtime.
It was added without replacing or weakening existing lesson flow, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, checks, skills, memory documents, or as-built/workflow synchronization.

- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md` explains the repository documents through learner-facing categories:
  - rules and routing,
  - design/as-built,
  - workflow state,
  - memory and decisions,
  - skills and reusable agent procedures.
- The guide explains `AGENTS.MD` as the lesson-side agent rulebook and separately explains product-side `AGENT.md` where relevant.
- The guide explains the `AGENTS.MD` invariant rules, document root table, routing table, and repo-local skills in non-engineer-friendly terms.
- The guide explains `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as the design/as-built trio.
- The guide explains `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as the paired progress and restart-context documents.
- The guide explains `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md` as developer intent and stable preference memory.
- The guide explains failure memory as product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records when used by the lesson, without inventing a lesson-side file that does not exist.
- `tools/docs-tour` provides `status`, `rules`, `design`, `workflow`, `memory`, `skills`, and `all` views.
- `tools/docs-tour` output uses the current learning mode when available:
  - A: fuller explanation with purpose, benefit, and examples,
  - B: short supplemental explanation,
  - C: file names and direct purposes only.
- `tools/dashboard docs` shows document categories, key files, current workflow relevance, workflow-pair sync status, as-built sync status, and a next recommended document action.
- `tools/dashboard all` includes the docs view without removing existing menu, lesson, development, or illustration views.
- Prompt examples are included so learners can ask an agent to explain `TASK_TRACKER` and `HANDOFF`, or the as-built trio, in plain language.
- 7-day and 14-day guidance introduces the documentation map before learners are expected to use the documents deeply.
- `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` covers guide presence, tour command behavior, dashboard docs output, prompt examples, structure integration, and as-built/workflow synchronization.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are part of the runtime dispatcher and aggregate checks.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- The new validation must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

### Implemented Product Repository Cleanup

The product-repository cleanup improvement is implemented in the current runtime.
It was added without replacing or weakening existing lesson flow, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, checks, skills, memory documents, product-gate behavior, GitHub/CI workflow, docs-tour behavior, or as-built/workflow synchronization.

- `tools/product-repository-cleanup` provides a dedicated cleanup entry point for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup status` inspects and prints the configured product repository path, local existence, nested-repository safety, Git repository status, configured repository name, remote URL when available, and remote GitHub existence when it can be checked safely.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup plan` prints the safe cleanup procedure without deleting anything.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup local --confirm task-tracker-repository` is the local deletion shape.
- Local deletion fails unless the target path is the configured external product repository path, is outside the lesson repository, matches the configured product repository name, contains `.git`, resolves as the Git top level, and receives the exact confirmation text.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup remote --confirm xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository` is the remote deletion shape.
- Remote deletion fails unless GitHub authentication works, the repository can be viewed, the owner/repository confirmation text matches exactly, and the target URL is shown before deletion.
- Local deletion and remote deletion remain separate operations; no `all` or automatic chained deletion operation is provided.
- The command prints a clear operation log for status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths.
- Runtime discovery is exposed through the menu, dashboard development view, README command list, AGENTS routing, and mechanical checks.
- Tests do not delete a real GitHub repository; they cover status/plan behavior, missing confirmation failures, wrong target failures, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` covers the cleanup command and is wired into structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup` and `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` are part of runtime dispatch and aggregate checks.
- The validation suite preserves existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

### Illustration Review Support

- `tools/illustrations list` shows illustration records.
- `tools/illustrations request <step_id> <topic>` records a request for a learner-facing educational PNG illustration.
- Actual image generation is still performed by the agent with `imagegen`.
- Generated or requested illustration metadata is stored under `illustrations/lesson14/`.
- `illustration-review/index.html` is the initial dedicated review page for large-format illustration review.

### As-Built Synchronization

- `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` describe the lesson-side as-built state.
- `reviews/SUBAGENT_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md` defines the multi-perspective review process.
- `tools/list_non_english_docs.sh` lists Markdown files that still contain Japanese text so translation work can be scoped explicitly.

### Implemented As-Built Sync Contract

The as-built sync-contract improvement is implemented in runtime.
It was added without replacing or weakening existing lesson flow, document-path support, as-built checks, workflow-pair checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard behavior, CI, pre-commit, docs-tour behavior, product-gate behavior, or product-repository cleanup behavior.

- `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` is the contract source for synchronized improvement IDs.
- Contract rows record sync ID, status, title, required artifacts, required tests, required document coverage, and runtime evidence where applicable.
- Each of the five synchronized documents includes matching sync blocks for each contract row:
  - `SYNC-ID`,
  - `STATUS`,
  - `ARTIFACTS`,
  - `TESTS`.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` validates the contract against all five documents.
- The validator fails when any sync ID is missing from any synchronized document.
- The validator fails when a synchronized document contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- The validator fails when planned and implemented statuses are mixed for the same sync ID.
- The validator fails when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- The validator fails when required artifacts or required tests listed by the contract are missing from the repository.
- The validator fails when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- For implemented sync IDs, the validator fails when required tests are not actively wired into aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit; comments or inert text mentions do not satisfy wiring.
- `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh` calls the sync-contract check while preserving the existing topic-based checks.
- `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` remains active for the `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` pair; the contract check adds five-document coverage instead of replacing pair synchronization.
- `tools/as-built-sync status` shows sync IDs, document coverage, artifact existence, and test-wiring status for learners and agents.
- `AGENTS.MD` exposes a routing-table entry and standard checks for the sync-contract status and validator.
- `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh` tests complete synchronization, a missing sync block, an unknown sync ID, mixed planned/implemented status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifacts, inert wiring, and missing active test wiring.
- CI, pre-commit, and aggregate test wiring now include the runtime validator and regression test.
- The implementation remains refactorable, ecosystem-friendly, reusable, general, and additive.

### Implemented Git Workflow Policy

The Git workflow policy lets users choose the Git-management permissions and automation level used by the lesson and post-lesson workflows.
It is additive and preserves existing lesson progression, approvals, menu prerequisites, dashboard behavior, product-gate behavior, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, and as-built synchronization.

- `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` defines supported policy keys, accepted values, defaults, and learner-facing labels.
- `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` stores the current selected values.
- `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh` provides reusable policy loading, validation, permission helpers, automation-level decisions, repository-context detection, and Git monitor helpers.
- `tools/git-workflow status` shows the selected policy and current Git monitoring result.
- `tools/git-workflow configure` guides users through the settings and shows safe copy-paste commands.
- `tools/git-workflow set <key> <value>` updates one setting after validating the key and value.
- `tools/git-workflow allow <branch|worktree|main-direct|commit|push|pr|ci|sync>` checks whether a requested Git action is allowed by the current settings.
- `tools/git-workflow check` inspects repository state, including uncommitted changes, local/remote divergence through configured upstreams, candidate cleanup branches, candidate cleanup worktrees, and whether the current repository is the lesson, product, or a custom repository.
- `tools/git-workflow cleanup-plan` lists candidate branch/worktree cleanup actions without deleting anything.
- The command layer separates lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.
- Supported branch policy includes allowing or disallowing normal working branches.
- Supported worktree policy includes allowing or disallowing `git worktree`.
- The policy includes a main-direct-work setting so direct work on `main` can be controlled explicitly.
- Automation levels are:
  - `manual`: guidance only.
  - `commit`: allow automated commit after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: allow automated push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks.
  - `sync`: allow automated main CI and local/remote synchronization checks.
- Destructive or high-impact operations remain confirmation-gated even when automation is enabled, including merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, and remote deletion.
- The policy is reusable across 7-day lessons, 14-day lessons, applied lessons, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration.
- Dashboard output reuses the status data to show Git-management readiness.
- Menu output exposes `./tools/git-workflow status` and `./tools/git-workflow configure` as the Git management settings entry.
- `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` validates default settings, setting changes, invalid setting rejection, branch/worktree permission decisions, automation-level decisions, dirty-state detection, local/remote sync detection, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` is wired into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit without replacing existing Git sync or CI checks.

### Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy

The menu-wide Git workflow policy makes the existing Git policy available as a shared menu-level control.
It is additive and preserves existing lesson progression, approval gates, menu prerequisite checks, dashboard behavior, product-gate behavior, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, docs-tour behavior, and as-built synchronization.

- The existing `tools/git-workflow` command remains the source for Git policy status, configuration, validation, action permission checks, repository monitoring, and cleanup planning.
- `tools/menu readiness` displays the current Git policy state for items 1 through 7.
- `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` adds Git policy validation without weakening the existing learning-mode, display-language, product-language, repository-boundary, or approval checks.
- `tools/menu check 7` and `tools/menu start 7 --confirm` provide a safe lesson-maintenance check/start path.
- Git policy validation confirms that `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` exists, `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` exists or can resolve defaults, selected values are valid, and repository context can be identified.
- `automation_level=manual` remains a valid pass state because it means Git automation is guidance-only.
- Menu-wide automation levels are interpreted consistently:
  - `manual`: guidance and monitoring only,
  - `commit`: commit-level automation only after required checks pass,
  - `pr_ci`: push, PR, and CI-check automation where applicable,
  - `sync`: main synchronization plus local/remote sync checks where applicable.
- Menu items that affect product repositories evaluate Git context against the product repository; lesson-maintenance evaluates Git context against the lesson repository.
- Dashboard output includes a menu-wide Git policy summary in the menu view without hiding existing dashboard sections.
- High-impact Git operations remain outside automatic menu progression unless explicit user confirmation is given.
- Runtime validation is added to menu prerequisite tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.

### Design Quality Constraints

- Additions must preserve existing 7-day and 14-day behavior.
- Tooling should reuse the existing `tools/lib` runtime/config patterns where practical.
- Checks should be composable so they can run independently or through `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Free Development Mode must stay stack-agnostic so learners can choose their ecosystem.
- No implementation may trade away an existing feature to add a new one.
- Remediation must remain refactorable, ecosystem-friendly, reusable, and general.

### Verification

- `tools/check_lesson_structure.sh` validates the 7-day structure.
- `tools/check_lesson14_structure.sh` validates the 14-day structure.
- `tools/check_lesson14_sync.sh` validates 14-day document synchronization.
- `tools/check_agents_skills.sh` validates AGENTS and skills integration.

- `tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh` validates that developer-memory requirements are represented mechanically.
- `tools/menu`, `tools/dashboard`, and `tools/illustrations` validate the menu, dashboard, and illustration entry points at runtime.
- `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` validates menu readiness, start approval, missing-prerequisite failure paths, the `3. 応用レッスン` label, and the absence of the old menu label.
- `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` validates product repository cleanup status, plan, confirmation gates, boundary rejection, non-Git rejection, temporary local deletion, and fake-`gh` remote deletion behavior.
- `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh` validates complete synchronization, unknown sync IDs, mixed statuses, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifacts, inert wiring, and missing active test wiring.
- `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` validates Git workflow setting validation, permission decisions, repository monitoring, local/upstream sync detection, repository separation, and non-destructive cleanup planning.
- `tools/test_lesson_start_position.sh` validates learner-selected start positions.
- `tools/test_lesson.sh` validates 7-day CLI behavior, including learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, and setup gating.
- `tools/test_lesson14.sh` validates lesson14 CLI behavior.
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` runs the lesson-side validation suite without requiring `task-tracker-repository`.
- `tools/test_production_operations.sh` validates the end-to-end production operations path when an external product repository exists.
- Latest local verification for the 7-day parity change passed `./tools/test_lesson.sh` and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Latest local verification for the language-list expansion passed `./tools/test_lesson.sh`, `./tools/test_lesson14.sh`, and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.

## Implemented Remediation Specification

The following specifications describe the implemented developer-memory remediation state.
They are additive to the current as-built components and must not weaken or replace existing lesson behavior.

### Role-Based Document Organization

- `AGENTS.MD` remains the root agent entry.
- Lesson-side design/as-built documents are addressed through a shared document-path layer.
- Workflow-state documents are addressed as a paired progress/restart-context group.
- Memory/decision documents are addressed as a separate memory group.
- Checks fail when final role-specific documents remain at the repository root after migration is complete.
- During migration, references in tools, guides, prompts, skills, dashboard output, CI, and tests are updated before root-level copies are removed.

### Learner-Facing Step Labels And Display Names

- Learner-facing materials use `Step N` labels where practical.
- Internal step IDs remain valid in TSV state files, command arguments, debug logs, and diagnostics.
- Runtime status and dashboard output map internal IDs to learner-friendly display names.
- Copy-paste command blocks may include internal IDs when the command requires them.

### Language Settings

- Workflow display language and product development language are separate settings in both 7-day and 14-day flows.
- Supported standard language codes are `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`.
- The legacy `zh` input is normalized to `zh-CN`.
- Non-empty unsupported values remain accepted as `custom` to preserve existing flexibility.
- Workflow display language controls lesson guidance, dashboard text, prompts, and facilitation output.
- Product development language controls generated or proposed product-side documents and product-facing text.
- The lesson repository source remains English.
- Dashboard and status commands show both settings when relevant.
- 7-day settings are stored in `learning/LESSON_MODE.tsv`, `learning/WORKFLOW_DISPLAY_LANGUAGE.tsv`, and `learning/PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE.tsv`.
- 14-day settings are stored in `learning/LESSON_MODE_14_DAYS.tsv`, `learning/WORKFLOW_DISPLAY_LANGUAGE_14_DAYS.tsv`, and `learning/PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE_14_DAYS.tsv`.

### Learning Mode Display Labels

- A/B/C remain stable internal learning-mode IDs.
- Learner-facing output displays:
  - A: `じっくり説明`.
  - B: `ほどよく説明`.
  - C: `手順だけ`.
- Runtime output, dashboard output, guides, prompts, and checks use or validate the display labels where learner-facing text is involved.

### Approval And Passage Guidance

- 14-day start actions require matching start approvals.
- 14-day pass actions require matching pass approvals.
- Checks validate that 14-day approval/action pairs are complete and in the correct order.
- 7-day progression keeps ordered runtime control and user-approval facilitation without adding receipt storage.
- Start/pass prompts invite questions before continuing.
- Command blocks are introduced with short learner-friendly explanations.

### Paired Workflow Documents

- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` are treated as one workflow-state pair.
- Checks validate compatible current status, next action, and restart context.
- Dashboard reports whether the pair is synchronized.
- A workflow-state update that changes only one file fails unless an explicit reason is recorded.

### As-Built Synchronization

- The five as-built documents agree on current status, completed work, remaining work, test evidence, and known gaps.
- Synchronization checks validate agreement rather than only checking for topic keywords.

### Dashboard Expansion

- Lesson dashboard shows current step, progress, 7-day and 14-day learning-mode labels, 7-day and 14-day workflow display language, 7-day and 14-day product development language, helpdesk/question records, developer-memory open items, next approval, sync-gate status, and illustration availability.
- Development dashboard shows product repository, current objective, workflow document status, paired tracker/handoff synchronization, developer-memory items, Git status, real CI status when available, and next recommended action.
- Dashboard data is structured so a future browser dashboard can reuse it without replacing CLI behavior.
- Dashboard product status uses the same configured product repository path that product checks use.

### Illustration Review Completion

- Illustration records include step, topic, status, asset path, learning mode, display language, source explanation, summary, key terms, and generation timestamp.
- Requested illustrations can be updated to available generated assets.
- Asset paths avoid collisions for non-ASCII topics.
- The review page reads illustration records and presents review material in a useful order with explanatory text.

### External Integration Path

- A dedicated external-integration CLI supports `status`, `start`, and `gate`.
- The path works both after Free Development Mode and from an existing product repository.
- The gate checks product scope documents (`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SPECIFICATION.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`), product boundary, paired workflow documents, Git sync, and CI when applicable.

### Lesson-Repository Playwright

- Playwright checks are required after `npm install` and validate dashboard and illustration-review quality.
- Existing CLI lesson flow, documentation checks, and sync gates remain active.
- Browser tests complement existing checks and do not replace them.

### CI, Pre-Commit, And Gate Failure Tests

- Strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and the aggregate lesson test are wired into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
- Free Development and Team Development tests cover success and failure paths, including missing product repository, dirty Git state, CI failure, Docker installed/not-installed paths, and status/start output.

## Product Repository Boundary

The default lesson-created product repository path is outside this repository:

```text
/home/masahiro/projects/task-tracker-repository
```

The boundary is checked by `tools/check_repository_boundary.sh --product-required`.
Lesson-repository validation does not recreate that repository and does not depend on it.
Real 7-day, 14-day, Free Development, and Team Development product workflows may require a product repository after the learner intentionally creates or selects one.
