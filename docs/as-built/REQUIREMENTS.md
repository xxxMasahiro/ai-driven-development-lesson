# REQUIREMENTS.md

## Purpose

`ai-driven-development-lesson` teaches AI-driven development as a practical workflow.
The repository must help learners move from structured lessons into real product development without losing the core habits: dialogue, explicit requirements, specifications, implementation planning, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, CI, review, and documentation.

## Required Capabilities

- Preserve the existing 7-day lesson.
- Preserve the existing 14-day lesson.
- Prevent accidental lesson progression without learner approval.
- Let learners choose explanation depth through learning modes A/B/C in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Allow the learning mode to be switched during either lesson.
- Let learners choose workflow display language and product development language in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Support common language choices for both language settings: `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`.
- Allow learners to start from any lesson topic intentionally, without weakening normal ordered progression.
- Teach agent dialogue and goal-oriented prompt refinement as a core skill.
- Teach sub-agent use as role-based viewpoints that are orchestrated toward a goal.
- Provide Free Development Mode after structured lessons.
- Let learners choose any product stack in Free Development Mode, including languages, frameworks, databases, payment systems, hosting, testing tools, APIs, and integrations.
- Provide an advanced Team Development and Docker module.
- Teach Docker from basics to practical container development when the learner chooses it.
- Show that AI agents can make setup, configuration, debugging, and documentation easier.
- Keep all additions compatible with existing lesson checks and flows.
- Implement additions with refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality in mind.
- Provide lesson-repository testing that does not require an external product repository.
- Keep the external product repository boundary explicit for real production operations tests.
- Keep as-built documents synchronized with the implemented lesson behavior.
- Provide a repeatable sub-agent review protocol for documentation, implementation, and learning-experience consistency.
- Provide Docker learning paths that work whether Docker is installed or not.
- Provide a document-language audit helper so remaining non-English Markdown can be found and translated without changing unrelated behavior.
- Provide a learner-facing menu command that groups learning, building/extending, and lesson-maintenance actions by intent.
- Provide a CLI dashboard for lesson status, development status, developer-memory themes, and illustration review availability.
- Provide an illustration request and review-material structure for learner-requested educational PNG illustrations.
- Support Role-Based Document Organization for role-specific Markdown files so design/as-built, workflow-state, and memory documents remain easy to find.
- Keep As-Built Synchronization explicit across the requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, and handoff documents.

## Implemented Remediation Requirements From Developer-Memory Audit

The 2026-06-02 developer-memory audit requirements are implemented additively.
The repository must keep the following remediation behavior active without trading away existing behavior or changing unrelated existing content.

- Organize lesson-side Markdown documents by role while keeping `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root.
- Provide a shared document-path layer so tools, checks, prompts, skills, and dashboard code do not hard-code final document locations.
- Move design/as-built documents, workflow-state documents, and memory/decision documents into separate directories through a safe migration.
- Remove final root-level copies of role-specific documents after references and checks are updated.
- Replace learner-facing `Day N` labels with `Step N` labels where practical.
- Hide internal step IDs from ordinary learner-facing output while preserving them for state files, command arguments, and diagnostics.
- Implement separate settings for workflow display language and product development language for both structured lesson versions.
- Preserve `zh` as a backward-compatible alias for `zh-CN`.
- Show learning-mode display names consistently while preserving A/B/C as internal IDs.
- Strengthen approval gates so start/pass actions require matching start/pass approvals.
- Make passage prompts invite questions and explain copy-paste command blocks in learner-friendly wording.
- Enforce `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized pair for workflow state and restart context.
- Strengthen as-built document synchronization beyond shallow topic checks.
- Expand the CLI dashboard to show current step, progress, 7-day and 14-day language settings, learning-mode labels, next approval, sync-gate status, workflow-pair status, real CI status when available, developer-memory items, and illustration availability.
- Complete illustration request, metadata, generated-asset registration, and review-page support.
- Add an external-integration CLI path that can follow Free Development Mode or start from an existing product repository.
- Introduce required lesson-repository Playwright checks for dashboard and illustration-review quality after dependencies are installed.
- Wire the strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
- Add failure-path tests for Free Development and Team Development gates.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Requirements

Menu prerequisite control is implemented additively and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, Free Development Mode, Team Development/Docker module, external-integration path, dashboard, checks, or repository-boundary behavior.

- The learner-facing menu item is named `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the advanced/team-development/Docker behavior available under the renamed applied-learning menu item.
- Require the same pre-start settings for menu items 1 through 6:
  - learning mode,
  - workflow display language,
  - product development language,
  - relevant repository context and boundary confirmation,
  - learner approval before starting.
- Reuse the 7-day and 14-day language and learning-mode settings where they already exist.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the latest configured structured-lesson settings when available; otherwise require the learner to select them before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for any product-side work, including Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration.
- Use shared prerequisite logic rather than duplicating menu-specific shell branches.
- Preserve `status` commands as non-blocking discovery commands; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Provide a mechanically checkable entry for `5. 成果物を改善` through `tools/product-improvement status|start|gate`.
- Expand dashboard readiness output so menu items 1 through 6 show whether learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context, and approval are ready.
- Keep requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, developer memory, README/menu guidance, and relevant checks synchronized with this runtime behavior.
- Add tests that positively confirm the renamed menu label `3. 応用レッスン` appears.
- Add tests that fail if the old menu label returns, if menu items 1 through 6 can start without required settings, if missing-prerequisite failure paths are not enforced, or if existing 7-day/14-day behavior regresses.

## Planned Documentation Map Requirements

The next lesson-improvement plan must explain the repository's many rule, routing, skill, design, workflow, and memory documents in language that non-engineer learners can understand.
This planned work is additive and must not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, checks, document synchronization, skills, memory workflow, or repository-boundary behavior.

- Add a learner-facing documentation map guide, planned as `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` as the lesson repository's agent rulebook, including invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills.
- Clearly distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.
- Explain `docs/as-built/` as the design/as-built area for requirements, specification, and implementation plan.
- Explain `docs/workflow/` as the work-state area for task tracking and handoff.
- Explain `docs/memory/` as the memory/decision area, currently including `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Explain failure memory as product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records where the lesson uses them, without falsely claiming that a lesson-side `docs/memory/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` file exists.
- Explain `skills/*/SKILL.md` as reusable agent procedures, not learner homework.
- Add a CLI tour command, planned as `tools/docs-tour`, with sections for rules, design, workflow, memory, skills, and all documents.
- Make the tour adapt to learning modes A/B/C so detailed learners get context, moderate learners get concise explanations, and workflow-only learners get file names and purposes.
- Add `./tools/dashboard docs` and include the docs view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Show document categories, each document's purpose, relevant current workflow documents, `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` pair status, and as-built synchronization status.
- Add copy-paste prompt examples that ask an agent to explain current progress and next actions from `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` in learner-friendly terms.
- Add early-lesson guidance for both 7-day and 14-day flows so learners understand why the documents exist before being asked to use them.
- Keep repository source documents in English while allowing lesson/runtime explanations to follow the selected workflow display language.
- Add mechanical checks, planned as `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and updates to existing structure/as-built/developer-memory checks, so the documentation-map guide, tour command, dashboard docs view, prompt examples, and synchronization are testable.
- At this planning-synchronization stage, `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are planned artifacts and are not yet required to exist.
- Implementation completion will require validation wiring through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Implementation verification must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Mechanical Enforcement

- 14-day progression requires approval receipts through `tools/lesson14 承認`.
- 7-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- 14-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- Developer-memory requirements are checked by `tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh`.
- Lesson-side validation is checked by `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- 7-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson.sh`.
- 14-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson14.sh`.
- Free/Team product gates are regression-tested with a temporary product repository through `tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh`.
- As-built document consistency is checked by `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Sub-agent review protocol presence is checked by `tools/check_review_protocol.sh`.
- Real product operations are checked by `tools/test_production_operations.sh` only when an external product repository exists.
- Free Development Mode is gated by `tools/free-development gate`.
- Team Development and Docker is gated by `tools/team-development gate`.
- Product Improvement is gated by `tools/product-improvement gate`.
- Menu prerequisites are checked by `tools/menu check <1|2|3|4|5|6>` and `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh`.
- The learner-facing menu is checked by `tools/menu` and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Dashboard and illustration entry points are checked by structure and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Remediation remains complete only while the audit items above are implemented, synchronized into these as-built documents, and covered by mechanical checks that fail when the requirement is missing.
- Remediation checks and implementations must remain refactorable, ecosystem-friendly, reusable, and general.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace the 7-day flow.
- Do not replace the 14-day flow.
- Do not introduce a tradeoff against existing behavior, checks, or learner workflows.
- Do not force a fixed product technology stack.
- Do not require Docker execution when Docker is not installed or the learner has not chosen container implementation.
- Do not skip requirements, specifications, plans, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, or CI in Free Development Mode.
- Do not recreate or depend on `task-tracker-repository` during lesson-repository validation.
- Do not weaken current tests, CLI commands, lesson flows, free-development flow, advanced modules, or repository-boundary rules while implementing remediation.
- Do not change unrelated existing documentation content as part of the remediation.

## Completion Criteria

- All lesson structure and sync checks pass.
- Developer-memory requirements check passes.
- Lesson repository aggregate test passes.
- Latest 7-day parity verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh` and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Latest language-list expansion verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh`, `./tools/test_lesson14.sh`, and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` reflect the same as-built state.
- `task-tracker-repository` remains outside this repository and may remain deleted unless a real product operations test is explicitly requested.
- The developer-memory audit remains cleared only while all remediation requirements in this document are implemented or mechanically enforced.
