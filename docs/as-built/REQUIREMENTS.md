# REQUIREMENTS.md

## Purpose

`ai-driven-development-lesson` teaches AI-driven development as a practical workflow.
The repository must help learners move from structured lessons into real product development without losing the core habits: dialogue, explicit requirements, specifications, implementation planning, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, CI, review, and documentation.

## Required Capabilities

- Preserve the existing 7-day lesson.
- Preserve the existing 14-day lesson.
- Prevent accidental lesson progression without learner approval.
- Let learners choose explanation depth through learning modes A/B/C in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Allow the learning mode to be switched during either lesson.
- Let learners choose workflow display language and product development language in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Support common language choices for both language settings: `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`.
- Allow learners to start from any lesson topic intentionally, without weakening normal ordered progression.
- Teach agent dialogue and goal-oriented prompt refinement as a core skill.
- Teach sub-agent use as role-based viewpoints that are orchestrated toward a goal.
- Provide Free Development Mode after structured lessons.
- Let learners choose any product stack in Free Development Mode, including languages, frameworks, databases, payment systems, hosting, testing tools, APIs, and integrations.
- Provide an advanced Team Development and Docker module.
- Teach Docker from basics to practical container development when the learner chooses it.
- Show that AI agents can make setup, configuration, debugging, and documentation easier.
- Keep all additions compatible with existing lesson checks and flows.
- Implement additions with refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality in mind.
- Provide lesson-repository testing that does not require an external product repository.
- Keep the external product repository boundary explicit for real production operations tests.
- Keep as-built documents synchronized with the implemented lesson behavior.
- Provide a repeatable sub-agent review protocol for documentation, implementation, and learning-experience consistency.
- Provide Docker learning paths that work whether Docker is installed or not.
- Provide a document-language audit helper so remaining non-English Markdown can be found and translated without changing unrelated behavior.
- Provide a learner-facing menu command that groups learning, building/extending, and lesson-maintenance actions by intent.
- Provide a CLI dashboard for lesson status, development status, developer-memory themes, and illustration review availability.
- Provide an illustration request and review-material structure for learner-requested educational PNG illustrations.
- Support Role-Based Document Organization for role-specific Markdown files so design/as-built, workflow-state, and memory documents remain easy to find.
- Keep As-Built Synchronization explicit across the requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, and handoff documents.
- Provide a resource-budgeted parallel execution guard for Git hooks, Playwright, CI, and aggregate checks without weakening existing serial verification paths.

## Implemented Remediation Requirements From Developer-Memory Audit

The 2026-06-02 developer-memory audit requirements are implemented additively.
The repository must keep the following remediation behavior active without trading away existing behavior or changing unrelated existing content.

- Organize lesson-side Markdown documents by role while keeping `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root.
- Provide a shared document-path layer so tools, checks, prompts, skills, and dashboard code do not hard-code final document locations.
- Move design/as-built documents, workflow-state documents, and memory/decision documents into separate directories through a safe migration.
- Remove final root-level copies of role-specific documents after references and checks are updated.
- Replace learner-facing `Day N` labels with `Step N` labels where practical.
- Hide internal step IDs from ordinary learner-facing output while preserving them for state files, command arguments, and diagnostics.
- Implement separate settings for workflow display language and product development language for both structured lesson versions.
- Preserve `zh` as a backward-compatible alias for `zh-CN`.
- Show learning-mode display names consistently while preserving A/B/C as internal IDs.
- Strengthen approval gates so start/pass actions require matching start/pass approvals.
- Make passage prompts invite questions and explain copy-paste command blocks in learner-friendly wording.
- Enforce `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized pair for workflow state and restart context.
- Strengthen as-built document synchronization beyond shallow topic checks.
- Expand the CLI dashboard to show current step, progress, 7-day and 14-day language settings, learning-mode labels, next approval, sync-gate status, workflow-pair status, real CI status when available, developer-memory items, and illustration availability.
- Complete illustration request, metadata, generated-asset registration, and review-page support.
- Add an external-integration CLI path that can follow Free Development Mode or start from an existing product repository.
- Introduce required lesson-repository Playwright checks for dashboard and illustration-review quality after dependencies are installed.
- Wire the strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
- Add failure-path tests for Free Development and Team Development gates.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Requirements

Menu prerequisite control is implemented additively and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, Free Development Mode, Team Development/Docker module, external-integration path, dashboard, checks, or repository-boundary behavior.

- The learner-facing menu item is named `3. 応用レッスン`.
- Keep the advanced/team-development/Docker behavior available under the renamed applied-learning menu item.
- Require the same pre-start settings for menu items 1 through 6:
  - learning mode,
  - workflow display language,
  - product development language,
  - relevant repository context and boundary confirmation,
  - learner approval before starting.
- Reuse the 7-day and 14-day language and learning-mode settings where they already exist.
- For applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration, inherit the most recently configured structured-lesson settings when available; otherwise require the learner to select them before start or gate passage.
- Keep product development language mandatory for any product-side work, including Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration.
- Use shared prerequisite logic rather than duplicating menu-specific shell branches.
- Preserve `status` commands as non-blocking discovery commands; enforce prerequisites through start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.
- Provide a mechanically checkable entry for `5. 成果物を改善` through `tools/product-improvement status|start|gate`.
- Expand dashboard readiness output so menu items 1 through 6 show whether learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context, and approval are ready.
- Keep requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, handoff, developer memory, README/menu guidance, and relevant checks synchronized with this runtime behavior.
- Add tests that positively confirm the renamed menu label `3. 応用レッスン` appears.
- Add tests that fail if the old menu label returns, if menu items 1 through 6 can start without required settings, if missing-prerequisite failure paths are not enforced, or if existing 7-day/14-day behavior regresses.

## Implemented Documentation Map Requirements

The lesson repository explains its many rule, routing, skill, design, workflow, and memory documents in language that non-engineer learners can understand.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, checks, document synchronization, skills, memory workflow, or repository-boundary behavior.

- Provide a learner-facing documentation map guide at `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
- Explain `AGENTS.MD` as the lesson repository's agent rulebook, including invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills.
- Clearly distinguish lesson-side `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.
- Explain `docs/as-built/` as the design/as-built area for requirements, specification, and implementation plan.
- Explain `docs/workflow/` as the work-state area for task tracking and handoff.
- Explain Git hook policy documents as workflow controls:
  - `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`,
  - `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`,
  - `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv`.
- Explain `docs/memory/` as the memory/decision area, currently including `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
- Explain failure memory as product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` or failure-recovery records where the lesson uses them, without falsely claiming that a lesson-side `docs/memory/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` file exists.
- Explain `skills/*/SKILL.md` as reusable agent procedures, not learner homework.
- Provide a CLI tour command at `tools/docs-tour`, with sections for status, rules, design, workflow, memory, skills, and all documents.
- Make the tour adapt to learning modes A/B/C so detailed learners get context, moderate learners get concise explanations, and workflow-only learners get file names and purposes.
- Provide `./tools/dashboard docs` and include the docs view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
- Show document categories, each document's purpose, relevant current workflow documents, `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` pair status, and as-built synchronization status.
- Add copy-paste prompt examples that ask an agent to explain current progress and next actions from `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` in learner-friendly terms.
- Add early-lesson guidance for both 7-day and 14-day flows so learners understand why the documents exist before being asked to use them.
- Keep repository source documents in English while allowing lesson/runtime explanations to follow the selected workflow display language.
- Provide mechanical checks through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh` and updates to existing structure/as-built/developer-memory checks, so the documentation-map guide, tour command, dashboard docs view, prompt examples, and synchronization are testable.
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are required runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Implementation verification preserves existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented Product Repository Cleanup Requirements

The lesson repository provides a safe, explicit cleanup path for the external product repository created by the 7-day or 14-day lessons.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, checks, document synchronization, product-gate behavior, GitHub/CI workflow, docs-tour behavior, or repository-boundary behavior.

- `tools/product-repository-cleanup` is the dedicated cleanup command.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup status` provides non-destructive discovery of the configured product repository path, local existence, Git status, nested-repository safety, configured repository name, remote URL when available, and remote GitHub status when safely checkable.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup plan` provides a non-destructive local and remote cleanup procedure preview.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup local --confirm task-tracker-repository` deletes only the configured local product repository after exact product-repository-name confirmation.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup remote --confirm xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository` deletes only the configured GitHub product repository after exact full owner/repository confirmation.
- Local deletion and remote deletion remain separate commands; there is no `all` command and no automatic chained local-plus-remote deletion.
- Cleanup commands show target path, configured product repository name, GitHub owner/repository target where relevant, and safety status before any destructive operation.
- The local target must resolve to the configured product repository path, normally `$HOME/projects/task-tracker-repository`.
- Local deletion is rejected if the target is inside the lesson repository, does not match the configured product repository name, is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, or cannot be identified as the Git top level safely.
- Local deletion requires exact confirmation text matching the configured product repository name.
- Remote deletion requires exact confirmation text matching the full GitHub owner/repository name.
- Remote deletion requires `gh`, GitHub authentication, and a successful `gh repo view` lookup before any delete call.
- Remote deletion shows the remote repository URL and owner/repository name immediately before deletion.
- Status, plan, local cleanup, and remote cleanup paths print clear operation logs.
- Dry-run and failure-path behavior is testable without deleting a real GitHub repository.
- `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` tests status, plan, missing confirmation, wrong confirmation, nested repository rejection, non-Git target rejection, temporary local cleanup behavior, and mocked remote deletion behavior.
- `tools/product-repository-cleanup` and `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` are required runtime artifacts.
- Validation is wired through `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Implementation verification preserves existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

## Implemented As-Built Sync Contract Requirements

The lesson repository strengthens mechanical enforcement for synchronization across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh`, lesson flow, dashboard, CI, pre-commit, docs-tour, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, or developer-memory requirement behavior.

- `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` records each synchronized improvement as a stable row.
- Each contract row must include a stable sync ID, status, title, required runtime artifacts, required tests, required document coverage, and runtime evidence where applicable.
- Require matching `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks in all five synchronized documents:
  - `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`,
  - `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`,
  - `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` fails when a contract sync ID is missing from any of the five documents.
- The check must fail when any of the five documents contains a `SYNC-ID` block that is absent from the contract.
- The check must fail when one document marks a sync ID as `planned` while another marks the same sync ID as `implemented`.
- The check must fail when document `ARTIFACTS` or `TESTS` blocks contain extra or missing entries compared with the contract.
- The check must fail when required artifacts or required tests listed in the contract are missing from the repository.
- The check must fail when runtime evidence files are missing or do not reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
- The check must fail when required tests are not actively wired into aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit after a sync ID is marked `implemented`; comments or inert text mentions are not enough.
- Keep the existing topic-based as-built check as a supporting compatibility check; do not remove or weaken it.
- Keep the existing `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md` workflow-pair check active; extend coverage rather than replacing the pair rule.
- `tools/as-built-sync status` shows sync IDs, five-document coverage, artifact presence, and test wiring status.
- `AGENTS.MD` routes sync-contract questions to the contract file, the five synchronized documents, and the new status/check commands.
- `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh` covers complete synchronization, missing document blocks, unknown sync IDs, mixed planned/implemented status, extra artifacts/tests, missing artifacts, inert wiring, and missing active test wiring.
- The sync-contract check and regression test are wired into `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
- Implementation must preserve refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, generality, and the no-existing-feature-tradeoff rule.

## Implemented Resource-Budgeted Parallel Guard Requirements

The lesson repository implements a conservative resource-budget guard for safe, optional parallel execution decisions around heavy verification work without trading away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, Git hooks mode, CI check, pre-commit check, document route, dashboard behavior, or repository-boundary behavior.
The implementation provides policy files, user settings, a shared resource library, a CLI command, Git hooks integration, Playwright worker integration, CI wiring, and standalone plus aggregate tests.

- Let the user configure a repository memory budget as a percentage of total memory.
- Let the user configure a repository swap budget from both a percentage of free storage and a GiB upper limit.
- Calculate the effective repository swap budget as the smaller of the storage-percentage value and the GiB upper limit.
- Let the user configure the available-memory floor that turns caution states into serial fallback or explicit parallel-mode safe stop.
- Inspect the real local environment before heavy local checks, including memory, swap, disk free space, and active heavy processes where practical.
- Allow limited parallel execution decisions only when the resource check passes and no active heavy-process caution is detected.
- Keep serial execution available as the safe fallback.
- Define explicit parallel mode as "parallel if safe, fail closed if caution prevents safe parallelism" rather than silently overriding resource safety.
- Treat unknown heavy-work profiles as configuration errors instead of silently falling back to a different profile.
- Treat the 90 percent safe-stop state as a failing gate for starting new heavy verification work, including job recommendation and Playwright wrapper entry points.
- Monitor repository swap-budget usage in 10 percent increments.
- Treat 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent as escalating stages for notice, warning, strong warning, parallel-addition stop, and serial fallback or safe stop.
- Avoid hidden OS mutation, `.wslconfig` writes, swap creation/deletion, `drop_caches`, privileged cleanup, arbitrary process killing, Docker/cgroups enforcement, or SafeFlow control-plane migration in the first implementation.
- Keep the resource guard reusable across Git hooks, Playwright, aggregate checks, and future CI/local verification design.
- Keep the new resource guard check runnable both standalone and from aggregate tests.

## Implemented Resource Guard Safe Cleanup Requirements

The lesson repository implements repo-local safe cleanup as an additive follow-up to the resource-budgeted parallel guard.
The goal is to prevent Playwright reports, test result directories, marked Git hooks cache files, and repo-local temporary artifacts from accumulating while preserving all existing lesson, CI, Git hooks, Playwright, documentation, and sync-contract behavior.

- Provide a cleanup workflow through the existing `tools/resource-guard` command.
- Keep cleanup targets in `docs/workflow/RESOURCE_POLICY.tsv` rather than hard-coded command branches.
- Keep cleanup settings in `learning/RESOURCE_SETTINGS.tsv` where user-facing resource behavior is already configured.
- Make dry-run inspection the default cleanup behavior.
- Require explicit `--safe` before any deletion occurs.
- Limit deletion to policy-approved paths inside the lesson repository.
- Reject repo-outside paths, path traversal, unsafe `.git` targets, and symlink escapes.
- Allow the marked `.git/pre-commit-cache` directory to be cleaned only when its cache marker is valid.
- Keep Playwright reports and test results cleanable without deleting global npm or Playwright caches.
- Keep cleanup tests runnable both standalone and from aggregate tests.
- Do not perform OS cache cleanup, `drop_caches`, swap mutation, `.wslconfig` mutation, Docker cleanup, process killing, or product repository deletion.
- Preserve existing `resource-guard status`, `check`, `recommend-jobs`, and `monitor` behavior.

## Implemented Resource Guard Summary And Parallel CI Requirements

The lesson repository must make resource guard behavior easier to understand and must use the existing resource guard decisions to improve verification speed without trading away safety, existing checks, or existing lesson behavior.
This implementation is synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md` and is present as runtime command, Git hooks runner, CI workflow, and regression-test behavior.

- Provide a user-facing `./tools/resource-guard summary` command that explains memory budget, swap budget, current state, local profile-specific recommended jobs, and the distinction between local and CI parallelism.
- Provide `./tools/resource-guard summary --short` for a compact operational view.
- Keep `status`, `monitor`, `recommend-jobs`, `check`, and `cleanup` unchanged as existing detailed or operational commands.
- Use existing `docs/workflow/RESOURCE_POLICY.tsv` profiles and existing `resource_guard_recommended_jobs` calculations instead of adding a `target_parallel_jobs` setting.
- Preserve the safety model where recommended jobs vary by workload profile; `git-hooks-full` may recommend four workers while Playwright and aggregate checks recommend fewer workers.
- Implement local Git hooks parallel execution only for checks explicitly classified as safe to run in parallel in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`.
- Keep serial execution available for checks that modify shared state, require ordered output, or are not classified as parallel-safe.
- Fall back to serial execution or stop safely when resource guard returns `serial`, `serial-fallback`, or `safe-stop`.
- Keep logs separated per check and display them in deterministic check order.
- Optimize GitHub Actions separately from local resource settings by splitting CI into runner-appropriate jobs rather than applying local `memory_budget_percent` directly to CI.
- Keep all existing checks present; CI job splitting must not remove or weaken existing verification.
- Require a CI workflow structure check so the split workflow mechanically verifies required job names, `needs` relationships, and required commands.
- Ensure the final CI aggregate and full-hooks gate installs npm dependencies and Playwright dependencies before running aggregate repository tests or full hooks.
- Preserve explicit local/CI separation: local Git hooks and Playwright may use resource guard recommendations, while CI full hooks must keep the CI-safe local-resource bypass behavior such as `RESOURCE_GUARD_SKIP_LOCAL_CHECK=1` or an equivalent documented mechanism.
- Provide standalone tests for summary output and Git hooks parallel execution, and wire them into aggregate, pre-commit, and CI verification.
- Keep the `resource_guard_summary_parallel_ci` sync contract implemented with actual runtime artifacts, runtime tests, and runtime evidence.
- Keep the design configuration-driven, reusable, and independent of a specific product stack or single learner-facing phrase.

## Planned Learner Context Foundation Requirements

The lesson repository now has planned learner-context source documents for the next lesson-content implementation cycle.
This is a documentation foundation only; runtime lesson output is not considered implemented until a separate implementation plan connects the context to the 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, applied lessons, dashboards, prompts, and checks.

- Provide a learner context directory at `learning/context/`.
- Keep the source context in English while preserving the existing runtime/display-language model for learner-facing output.
- Provide a main AI-driven development foundation text that explains purpose, dialogue, documents, Git, CI, tests, memory, skills, sub-agents, MCP/API, governance, security, quality, and free development.
- Provide a security foundation that covers prompt injection, secrets, permissions, external APIs, dependencies, Git/CI safety, and staged 7-day, 14-day, and applied security learning.
- Provide a machine-readable context map that future implementation can use to connect topics to lesson openings, per-topic explanations, recaps, and dashboard candidates.
- Preserve the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow, Git hooks, as-built sync, docs-tour, and product-repository cleanup behavior.
- Do not mark runtime integration as complete until the next implementation plan adds tests and connects the context to lesson output.

## Planned Learner Context Runtime Integration Requirements

The lesson repository must connect the learner-context foundation to runtime guidance without treating all menu items as lessons.
This planned work is additive and must not trade away the existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, applied lesson, Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, lesson-maintenance behavior, menu behavior, dashboard behavior, Git workflow policy, Git hooks policy, CI, pre-commit, docs-tour, or as-built sync behavior.

- Treat 7-day, 14-day, and applied modules as learning contexts.
- Treat Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson repository improvement as workflow contexts, not lessons.
- Keep Free Development Mode as a post-lesson or already-trained-user workflow that applies the repository's recommended AI-driven development process to user-selected products.
- Provide runtime guidance that can show opening context, per-topic context, and recap context for structured learning paths.
- Provide workflow guidance that can show purpose, required documents, safety checks, and copy-paste prompts for product-facing workflows.
- Use the existing learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, menu prerequisite, Git workflow, dashboard, and repository-boundary systems.
- Add or extend machine-readable context maps instead of hard-coding one-off branches or fixed phrases.
- Keep repository source context in English while allowing runtime facilitation to follow the selected workflow display language.
- Add a standalone context command and regression test that can also be called from aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
- Keep new checks independent of a specific product stack, specific learner-facing phrase, or single narrow example.
- Do not mark this runtime integration as implemented until the command surface, lesson/workflow integration, dashboard integration, documentation synchronization, and tests are complete.

## Implemented Git Workflow Policy Requirements

The lesson repository lets users configure how much Git management and Git automation they want the workflow agent to perform.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, free-development, product-improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Provide a Git workflow policy definition at `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv`.
- Provide current user-selected Git workflow settings at `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv`.
- Let users allow or disallow normal working branches.
- Let users allow or disallow `git worktree`.
- Let users control whether direct work on `main` is allowed.
- Provide Git automation levels:
  - `manual`: Git actions are guidance only.
  - `commit`: the agent may proceed through commit after checks pass.
  - `pr_ci`: the agent may proceed through push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks.
  - `sync`: the agent may proceed through main CI plus local/remote synchronization checks.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive Git operations behind explicit user confirmation even when automation is enabled.
- Provide Git monitoring for uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, local/remote divergence, unnecessary working branches, unnecessary worktrees, and current repository context.
- Provide a reusable command interface through `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan`.
- Keep cleanup planning non-destructive; deletion commands are out of scope for the initial Git workflow policy plan.
- Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix the two repositories.
- Reuse existing `tools/lib` patterns, repository-boundary checks, Git sync checks, CI checks, menu prerequisites, dashboard views, and aggregate tests where practical.
- Add `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` to validate setting changes, invalid setting rejection, branch/worktree permission checks, automation-level decisions, dirty state detection, and local/remote sync monitoring.
- Wire `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` into structure checks, as-built checks, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit without replacing existing Git sync or CI checks.

## Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy Requirements

The lesson repository promotes Git workflow policy from a standalone support setting into a shared menu-level policy used across learning, building/extending, and lesson-maintenance paths.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, applied lesson, Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, lesson-maintenance, dashboard, cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` as the existing Git policy source and command surface.
- Make menu categories reference the same Git policy:
  - learning paths: 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, and applied lesson,
  - building and extending paths: Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, and External Integration,
  - lesson-maintenance path: lesson repository improvement.
- Show Git policy readiness in `tools/menu readiness` for menu items 1 through 7.
- Extend menu checks so Git policy files, selected values, and repository context are validated before menu workflows start.
- Keep `automation_level=manual` valid and non-blocking so existing workflows continue to start when Git automation is guidance-only.
- Interpret automation levels consistently across menu items:
  - `manual`: guidance and monitoring only,
  - `commit`: allow commit-level automation after required checks pass,
  - `pr_ci`: allow push, PR, and CI-check automation where applicable,
  - `sync`: allow main synchronization and local/remote sync checks where applicable.
- Keep merge, branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and other destructive operations behind explicit user confirmation regardless of automation level.
- Add a safe check/start path for menu item 7 without weakening existing item 1 through 6 checks.
- Show menu-wide Git policy status in dashboard output.
- Add tests so invalid Git policy values, missing policy files, menu readiness output, item 1 through 7 checks, and no-tradeoff behavior are mechanically verified.

## Implemented Git Workflow Action Settings Requirements

The lesson repository must let users configure the manual or automatic behavior of each common Git workflow action.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away existing `branch_allowed`, `worktree_allowed`, `main_direct_work_allowed`, `automation_level`, menu, dashboard, CI, cleanup, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

- Keep the existing Git management settings:
  - `branch_allowed`
  - `worktree_allowed`
  - `main_direct_work_allowed`
  - `automation_level`
- Treat `automation_level` as a compatibility preset for broad Git write automation.
- Add detailed action settings that can override the broad preset when the detailed setting key is present:
  - `commit_automation: manual|auto`
  - `push_automation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_creation: manual|auto`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `merge_execution: manual|after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false|true`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: manual|auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: manual|auto`
- Detailed settings take precedence only when the detailed setting key is present.
- Preserve current `automation_level` behavior when a detailed setting key is absent.
- Use safety-oriented defaults:
  - `commit_automation: auto`
  - `push_automation: manual`
  - `pr_creation: manual`
  - `pr_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `merge_execution: after_approval`
  - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false`
  - `main_ci_monitoring: auto`
  - `sync_monitoring: auto`
- These detailed defaults are active after implementation; `automation_level` remains available as a compatibility preset when detailed action keys are absent.
- Preserve `ci` as a compatibility alias for CI monitoring so existing `tools/git-workflow allow ci` behavior is not removed.
- For push and PR creation, `auto` means the agent may execute the operation only after explicit approval for that operation is recorded; it never means approval-free execution.
- `merge_execution: after_approval` means the agent may execute merge only after explicit merge approval is recorded.
- Store Git action approvals in `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_APPROVALS.tsv` and require matching action, repository, and branch receipts for detailed push, PR creation, and normal merge execution.
- `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` is a developer-responsibility setting that may permit approval-free merge only when required gates pass: PR CI success, target PR and branch are clear, merge base is verified, the working tree is clean, local and remote state are checked, and failures stop the workflow.
- Developer-responsibility auto-merge must require gate evidence plus the actual Git repository state; setting `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` alone is not sufficient.
- Keep branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository deletion behind explicit user confirmation regardless of merge settings.
- Let users inspect and change these detailed settings from the same Git management command surface: `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set`.
- Show the detailed settings in menu readiness and dashboard menu output.
- Apply the same detailed settings to menu items 1 through 7.
- Add tests for default values, valid changes, invalid value rejection, detailed-setting precedence, menu display, dashboard display, and preservation of existing lesson and product workflows.

## Implemented Git Hooks Policy Requirements

The lesson repository makes the existing pre-commit gate faster and easier to operate without weakening its safety.
This implemented work is additive and does not trade away any existing 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, menu, dashboard, Git workflow policy, CI, pre-commit, documentation route, sync-contract behavior, or repo-local skill behavior.

- Keep the pre-commit workflow safe and serial by default.
- Avoid a normal learner-facing `off` mode for Git hooks; disabling safety checks is outside the standard workflow.
- Provide explicit Git hooks modes through `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv` and `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv`:
  - `full`: run coverage equivalent to the current required pre-commit checks.
  - `fast`: use a cache to skip only checks that previously passed with unchanged relevant inputs.
  - `minimal`: run only the smallest safe mechanical set required for local orientation, never as a replacement for full verification before completion.
- Store the implemented check list in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` so the runner does not hard-code the pre-commit command list.
- Store the local full/no-cache recommendation path policy in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` so the runner does not hard-code which changed files require heavier local verification.
- Treat malformed `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` rows, including unknown or empty mode tokens, as fail-closed configuration errors.
- Treat malformed `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` rows as fail-closed configuration errors.
- Store hook cache data outside version control, under a Git-local cache area such as `.git/pre-commit-cache/`.
- Treat missing, stale, or corrupted cache entries as cache misses that force the relevant check to run.
- Build cache keys from reusable inputs such as hook mode, command identity, tool hashes, relevant file hashes, and staged or working-tree changes where practical.
- Keep CI and completion verification on full or no-cache execution so local cache behavior cannot hide regressions.
- Keep ordinary local pre-commit operation on the selected mode, such as `minimal`, while preserving full/no-cache CI as the final verification.
- Recommend local `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache` when changed files match the recommendation policy for Git hooks, CI, checks, tests, or as-built synchronization.
- Connect the implementation to existing settings, shared libraries, aggregate tests, CI, pre-commit, and repo-local skills instead of adding fixed one-off branches.
- Keep existing pre-commit wiring checks active by recognizing the `tools/git-hooks` runner plus `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` as active wiring, not as inert text.
- Keep new checks runnable as standalone commands and through the aggregate lesson repository test.
- Do not depend on a specific product stack, a specific learner-facing phrase, or one narrow case.
- Make the command surface learner-readable, including status, local verification recommendation, mode selection, cache clearing, normal run, no-cache run, and explicit mode run.
- Keep failure behavior conservative: if the hook runner cannot prove a cached pass is valid, it must run the check or fail.
- `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` must validate standalone policy and cache behavior: mode validation, invalid persisted settings, malformed check rows, invalid or empty check-row mode tokens, local full/no-cache recommendation behavior, cache-hit and cache-miss behavior, cache invalidation, no-cache behavior, minimal-mode required checks, failing-check cache refusal, and safe cache clearing.
- Full/no-cache coverage, aggregate-test wiring, CI wiring, and preservation of existing pre-commit behavior must be verified through `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and the CI workflow definitions.
- Require developer approval before changing the minimal-mode required check list or skipping Playwright-related checks through cache beyond the implemented fail-closed cache behavior.

## Mechanical Enforcement

- 14-day progression requires approval receipts through `tools/lesson14 承認`.
- 7-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- 14-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- Developer-memory requirements are checked by `tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh`.
- Lesson-side validation is checked by `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- 7-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson.sh`.
- 14-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson14.sh`.
- Free/Team product gates are regression-tested with a temporary product repository through `tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh`.
- Product repository cleanup is regression-tested with temporary local repositories and a fake `gh` command through `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
- As-built document consistency is checked by `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Sub-agent review protocol presence is checked by `tools/check_review_protocol.sh`.

- The learner-facing menu is checked by `tools/menu` and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Git workflow policy settings are checked by `tools/git-workflow status`, `tools/git-workflow cleanup-plan`, and `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh`.
- Git hooks policy settings are checked by `tools/git-hooks status`, `tools/test_git_hooks.sh`, and full/no-cache CI hook runs.
- Dashboard and illustration entry points are checked by structure and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Remediation remains complete only while the audit items above are implemented, synchronized into these as-built documents, and covered by mechanical checks that fail when the requirement is missing.
- Remediation checks and implementations must remain refactorable, ecosystem-friendly, reusable, and general.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace the 7-day flow.
- Do not replace the 14-day flow.
- Do not introduce a tradeoff against existing behavior, checks, or learner workflows.
- Do not force a fixed product technology stack.
- Do not require Docker execution when Docker is not installed or the learner has not chosen container implementation.
- Do not skip requirements, specifications, plans, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, or CI in Free Development Mode.
- Do not recreate or depend on `task-tracker-repository` during lesson-repository validation.
- Do not weaken current tests, CLI commands, lesson flows, free-development flow, advanced modules, or repository-boundary rules while implementing remediation.
- Do not change unrelated existing documentation content as part of the remediation.

## Completion Criteria

- All lesson structure and sync checks pass.
- Developer-memory requirements check passes.
- Lesson repository aggregate test passes.
- Implemented 7-day parity verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh` and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Implemented language-list expansion verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh`, `./tools/test_lesson14.sh`, and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` reflect the same as-built state.
- `task-tracker-repository` remains outside this repository and may remain deleted unless a real product operations test is explicitly requested.
- The developer-memory audit remains cleared only while all remediation requirements in this document are implemented or mechanically enforced.
