# REQUIREMENTS.md

## Purpose

`ai-driven-development-lesson` teaches AI-driven development as a practical workflow.
The repository must help learners move from structured lessons into real product development without losing the core habits: dialogue, explicit requirements, specifications, implementation planning, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, CI, review, and documentation.

## Required Capabilities

- Preserve the existing 7-day lesson.
- Preserve the existing 14-day lesson.
- Prevent accidental lesson progression without learner approval.
- Let learners choose explanation depth through learning modes A/B/C in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Allow the learning mode to be switched during either lesson.
- Let learners choose workflow display language and product development language in both the 7-day and 14-day lessons.
- Support common language choices for both language settings: `ja`, `en`, `ko`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `fr`, `de`, `id`, `vi`, `th`, `hi`, and `ar`.
- Allow learners to start from any lesson topic intentionally, without weakening normal ordered progression.
- Teach agent dialogue and goal-oriented prompt refinement as a core skill.
- Teach sub-agent use as role-based viewpoints that are orchestrated toward a goal.
- Provide Free Development Mode after structured lessons.
- Let learners choose any product stack in Free Development Mode, including languages, frameworks, databases, payment systems, hosting, testing tools, APIs, and integrations.
- Provide an advanced Team Development and Docker module.
- Teach Docker from basics to practical container development when the learner chooses it.
- Show that AI agents can make setup, configuration, debugging, and documentation easier.
- Keep all additions compatible with existing lesson checks and flows.
- Implement additions with refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality in mind.
- Provide lesson-repository testing that does not require an external product repository.
- Keep the external product repository boundary explicit for real production operations tests.
- Keep as-built documents synchronized with the implemented lesson behavior.
- Provide a repeatable sub-agent review protocol for documentation, implementation, and learning-experience consistency.
- Provide Docker learning paths that work whether Docker is installed or not.
- Provide a document-language audit helper so remaining non-English Markdown can be found and translated without changing unrelated behavior.
- Provide a learner-facing menu command that groups learning, building/extending, and lesson-maintenance actions by intent.
- Provide a CLI dashboard for lesson status, development status, developer-memory themes, and illustration review availability.
- Provide an illustration request and review-material structure for learner-requested educational PNG illustrations.
- Support Role-Based Document Organization for role-specific Markdown files so design/as-built, workflow-state, and memory documents remain easy to find.
- Keep As-Built Synchronization explicit across the requirements, specification, implementation plan, task tracker, and handoff documents.

## Implemented Remediation Requirements From Developer-Memory Audit

The 2026-06-02 developer-memory audit requirements are implemented additively.
The repository must keep the following remediation behavior active without trading away existing behavior or changing unrelated existing content.

- Organize lesson-side Markdown documents by role while keeping `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root.
- Provide a shared document-path layer so tools, checks, prompts, skills, and dashboard code do not hard-code final document locations.
- Move design/as-built documents, workflow-state documents, and memory/decision documents into separate directories through a safe migration.
- Remove final root-level copies of role-specific documents after references and checks are updated.
- Replace learner-facing `Day N` labels with `Step N` labels where practical.
- Hide internal step IDs from ordinary learner-facing output while preserving them for state files, command arguments, and diagnostics.
- Implement separate settings for workflow display language and product development language for both structured lesson versions.
- Preserve `zh` as a backward-compatible alias for `zh-CN`.
- Show learning-mode display names consistently while preserving A/B/C as internal IDs.
- Strengthen approval gates so start/pass actions require matching start/pass approvals.
- Make passage prompts invite questions and explain copy-paste command blocks in learner-friendly wording.
- Enforce `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized pair for workflow state and restart context.
- Strengthen as-built document synchronization beyond shallow topic checks.
- Expand the CLI dashboard to show current step, progress, 7-day and 14-day language settings, learning-mode labels, next approval, sync-gate status, workflow-pair status, real CI status when available, developer-memory items, and illustration availability.
- Complete illustration request, metadata, generated-asset registration, and review-page support.
- Add an external-integration CLI path that can follow Free Development Mode or start from an existing product repository.
- Introduce required lesson-repository Playwright checks for dashboard and illustration-review quality after dependencies are installed.
- Wire the strengthened checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests into CI and pre-commit without removing existing checks.
- Add failure-path tests for Free Development and Team Development gates.

## Mechanical Enforcement

- 14-day progression requires approval receipts through `tools/lesson14 承認`.
- 7-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- 14-day `setup.index` cannot pass before learning mode, workflow display language, and product development language are selected.
- Developer-memory requirements are checked by `tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh`.
- Lesson-side validation is checked by `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- 7-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson.sh`.
- 14-day CLI behavior is checked by `tools/test_lesson14.sh`.
- Free/Team product gates are regression-tested with a temporary product repository through `tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh`.
- As-built document consistency is checked by `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
- Sub-agent review protocol presence is checked by `tools/check_review_protocol.sh`.
- Real product operations are checked by `tools/test_production_operations.sh` only when an external product repository exists.
- Free Development Mode is gated by `tools/free-development gate`.
- Team Development and Docker is gated by `tools/team-development gate`.
- The learner-facing menu is checked by `tools/menu` and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Dashboard and illustration entry points are checked by structure and developer-memory requirement checks.
- Remediation remains complete only while the audit items above are implemented, synchronized into these as-built documents, and covered by mechanical checks that fail when the requirement is missing.
- Remediation checks and implementations must remain refactorable, ecosystem-friendly, reusable, and general.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace the 7-day flow.
- Do not replace the 14-day flow.
- Do not introduce a tradeoff against existing behavior, checks, or learner workflows.
- Do not force a fixed product technology stack.
- Do not require Docker execution when Docker is not installed or the learner has not chosen container implementation.
- Do not skip requirements, specifications, plans, task tracking, handoff, Git sync, tests, or CI in Free Development Mode.
- Do not recreate or depend on `task-tracker-repository` during lesson-repository validation.
- Do not weaken current tests, CLI commands, lesson flows, free-development flow, advanced modules, or repository-boundary rules while implementing remediation.
- Do not change unrelated existing documentation content as part of the remediation.

## Completion Criteria

- All lesson structure and sync checks pass.
- Developer-memory requirements check passes.
- Lesson repository aggregate test passes.
- Latest 7-day parity verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh` and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- Latest language-list expansion verification passes `./tools/test_lesson.sh`, `./tools/test_lesson14.sh`, and `./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` reflect the same as-built state.
- `task-tracker-repository` remains outside this repository and may remain deleted unless a real product operations test is explicitly requested.
- The developer-memory audit remains cleared only while all remediation requirements in this document are implemented or mechanically enforced.
