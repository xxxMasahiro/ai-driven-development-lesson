## Implemented Remediation Plan

This plan implements the developer-memory audit.
It is additive and must not trade away existing 7-day lessons, 14-step lessons, free-development flow, advanced modules, existing checks, or repository-boundary behavior.

1. Add shared document-path support.
   - Add a reusable document path layer for design/as-built documents, workflow-state documents, and memory/decision documents.
   - Update tools to consume the shared path layer instead of hard-coding root-level paths.

2. Safely migrate role-specific Markdown documents.
   - Keep `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root.
   - Move design/as-built documents into a design/as-built directory.
   - Move workflow-state documents into a workflow/progress directory.
   - Move developer memory and related memory documents into a memory/decision directory.
   - Update references in README, AGENTS, guides, prompts, skills, dashboard, checks, CI, and tests.
   - Remove final root-level role-specific copies only after references and checks are updated.

3. Replace learner-facing `Day` labels with `Step` labels.
   - Update learner-facing guides, roadmap, prompts, runtime output, dashboard text, and reusable guidance.
   - Keep internal IDs and state-file values stable where technically necessary.
   - Add checks that prevent old learner-facing `Day N` labels from returning.

4. Hide internal IDs in learner-facing output.
   - Add or reuse display-label mapping for internal step IDs.
   - Show internal IDs only in copy-paste command blocks, debug output, raw state files, or developer diagnostics.
   - Validate dashboard/status output against this rule.

5. Implement language settings.
   - Add workflow display language state for 7-day and 14-day lessons.
   - Add product development language state for 7-day and 14-day lessons.
   - Add CLI commands and status output for both settings in `tools/lesson` and `tools/lesson14`.
   - Add a shared supported-language list and language normalizer in `tools/lib/lesson_common.sh`.
   - Show both settings in dashboard output where relevant.
   - Add tests for selection, switching, and required prompts before product development.

6. Enforce learning-mode display names.
   - Preserve A/B/C internal IDs.
   - Display `じっくり説明`, `ほどよく説明`, and `手順だけ` in learner-facing output.
   - Update guides, prompts, dashboard, and tests.

7. Strengthen approval gates.
   - Require start approval before start.
   - Require pass approval before pass.
   - Validate approval/action ordering and pairing.
   - Add negative tests for missing or mismatched approvals.

8. Improve passage prompts and command-block explanations.
   - Ensure pass/start prompts invite questions.
   - Add short explanations before copy-paste command blocks.
   - Add checks for reusable guidance text.

9. Enforce paired `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` synchronization.
   - Add a workflow-pair synchronization checker.
   - Validate compatible current state, next action, and restart context.
   - Detect one-sided workflow-state updates without an explicit reason.
   - Surface pair status in dashboard output.

10. Strengthen as-built synchronization.
    - Update checks so the five as-built documents agree on current status, completed work, remaining work, test evidence, and known gaps.
    - Keep topic checks only as a supporting signal, not the primary pass condition.

11. Expand the CLI dashboard.
    - Lesson view shows current step, progress, 7-day and 14-day learning-mode labels, workflow display language, product development language where relevant, helpdesk/question records, developer-memory open items, next approval, sync-gate status, and illustration availability.
    - Development view shows product repository, current objective, workflow document status, paired tracker/handoff synchronization, developer-memory items, Git status, real CI status when available, and next recommended action.
    - Keep dashboard data reusable for a future browser dashboard.

12. Complete illustration request and review support.
    - Expand illustration metadata with learning mode, display language, source explanation, summary, key terms, and generation timestamp.
    - Add a command path to mark requested illustrations as available after generated PNG assets are provided.
    - Avoid non-ASCII topic path collisions.
    - Update the review page to read records and display ordered review material with explanatory text.

13. Add an external-integration CLI path.
    - Add `status`, `start`, and `gate` actions.
    - Support both post-Free-Development progression and direct use with an existing product repository.
    - Check product scope documents (`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SPECIFICATION.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`), product boundary, paired workflow documents, Git sync, and CI where applicable.

14. Introduce lesson-repository Playwright checks.
    - Add Playwright setup for dashboard and illustration-review pages.
    - Keep CLI checks and documentation checks active.
    - Require browser checks after `npm install` in CI, pre-commit, and aggregate tests.

15. Wire strengthened checks into CI and pre-commit.
    - Add new checks to the aggregate lesson repository test.
    - Add critical checks, product-gate tests, Playwright checks, and aggregate tests to pre-commit.
    - Add aggregate validation to CI without removing existing CI jobs.

16. Expand Free Development and Team Development gate tests.
    - Add missing-product-repository tests.
    - Add dirty-Git-state tests.
    - Add CI-failure tests.
    - Add Docker installed/not-installed path tests.
    - Add status/start output tests.

## Implemented Menu Prerequisite Implementation

This additive implementation is synchronized across `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
It preserves existing features without tradeoffs and follows the repository quality constraints for refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality.

1. Rename the learner-facing menu item.
   - Change `3. 発展・応用レッスン` to `3. 応用レッスン`.
   - Keep the existing Team Development and Docker entry available through the renamed applied-learning item.
   - Add a check that prevents the old learner-facing label from returning.

2. Define one prerequisite model for menu items 1 through 6.
   - Require learning mode.
   - Require workflow display language.
   - Require product development language.
   - Require repository context and boundary confirmation where the item touches a product repository.
   - Require learner approval before start.

3. Reuse existing structured-lesson settings.
   - Keep 7-day settings stored in the current 7-day state files.
   - Keep 14-day settings stored in the current 14-day state files.
   - Preserve the expanded standard language list, `zh` compatibility alias, and `custom` flexibility.

4. Add a shared settings and prerequisite layer.
   - Add shared reusable helper functions in `tools/lib/lesson_common.sh`.
   - Provide a shared settings view for applied-learning, Free Development Mode, product improvement, and external integration.
   - Inherit the most recently configured 7-day or 14-day settings when available.
   - Fail start/gate/check commands with learner-friendly guidance when required settings are missing.

5. Preserve discoverability.
   - Keep `status` commands non-blocking so learners can inspect menu items before configuring everything.
   - Enforce prerequisites in start, gate, or explicit menu-check commands.

6. Add or formalize product improvement control.
   - Add `tools/product-improvement status|start|gate`, or an equivalent reusable product-improvement gate.
   - Treat product improvement as the bridge between Free Development Mode and external integration.
   - Require product development language for product-facing edits.

7. Expand dashboard readiness.
   - Show readiness for menu items 1 through 6.
   - Include learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository context, approval status, and next recommended action.
   - Preserve existing lesson, development, developer-memory, and illustration dashboard information.

8. Synchronize documentation and checks.
   - Update the five planning/workflow documents.
   - Update developer memory, README/menu guidance, AGENTS routing, and related checks.
   - Keep unrelated existing content unchanged.

9. Verify with tests.
   - Run existing lesson and repository checks.
   - Add targeted tests for the renamed menu label and missing-prerequisite failure paths.
   - Confirm existing 7-day and 14-day flows still pass.
   - Confirm Free Development Mode, Team Development, external integration, dashboard, and product gates remain available.

## Implemented Documentation Map Implementation Plan

This additive implementation is complete and synchronized across `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
It preserves existing features without tradeoffs and follows the repository quality constraints for refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality.

1. Add a learner-facing documentation map guide.
   - Created `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`.
   - Explained rules/routing, design/as-built, workflow state, memory/decisions, and skills as separate categories.
   - Used non-engineer-friendly explanations while keeping repository source text in English.

2. Explain the agent rule and routing layer.
   - Explained `AGENTS.MD` as the lesson-side rulebook for agents.
   - Covered invariant rules, document root, routing table, and repo-local skills.
   - Explicitly distinguished `AGENTS.MD` from product-side `AGENT.md`.

3. Explain design, workflow, and memory documents.
   - Explained `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, and `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
   - Explained `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` as a synchronized pair.
   - Explained `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, and `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv` as the Git hook policy and current local hook-mode controls.
   - Explained `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
   - Explained product-side `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` and failure-recovery records without implying a lesson-side `docs/memory/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` exists.

4. Add a CLI tour command.
   - Added `tools/docs-tour`.
   - Support `status`, `rules`, `design`, `workflow`, `memory`, `skills`, and `all`.
   - Adapt explanation depth to learning modes A/B/C.

5. Add a dashboard docs view.
   - Added `./tools/dashboard docs`.
   - Included the docs view in `./tools/dashboard all`.
   - Show categories, key files, current workflow relevance, workflow-pair sync, as-built sync, and next recommended document action.

6. Add copy-paste prompt examples.
   - Added document-understanding prompts to the prompt files.
   - Included prompts for explaining `TASK_TRACKER`/`HANDOFF` and the as-built trio in learner-friendly language.

7. Add early lesson guidance.
   - Added non-disruptive guidance to 7-day and 14-day lesson materials so learners encounter the document map before document-heavy work.
   - Preserve ordered lesson progression and approval gates.

8. Add mechanical validation.
   - Added `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`.
   - Updated structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit as needed.
   - Ensure checks fail if `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `dashboard docs`, prompt examples, or the synchronized planning/workflow entries are missing.
   - `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`, `tools/docs-tour`, `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, and `./tools/dashboard docs` are now expected to exist in runtime.
   - Validation is wired through `tools/test_docs_tour.sh`, structure checks, as-built checks, developer-memory checks, dashboard or Playwright tests, aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
   - The validation suite must preserve existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

9. Verify with existing and new tests.
   - Run the existing lesson-side verification sequence.
   - Run the new docs-tour test.
   - Confirm existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, free-development, product-improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, CI, and pre-commit behavior remains available.

## Implemented Product Repository Cleanup Implementation Plan

This additive implementation is complete and synchronized across `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`, and `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
It preserves existing features without tradeoffs and follows the repository quality constraints for refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality.

1. Add a dedicated cleanup command.
   - Added `tools/product-repository-cleanup`.
   - Support `status`, `plan`, `local`, and `remote` subcommands.
   - Keep the command focused on the external product repository configured by the lesson settings.

2. Implement non-destructive status and plan views.
   - `status` prints the configured product repository path, local existence, Git status, repository-name match, nested-repository safety, remote URL, and remote existence when safely checkable.
   - `plan` prints the local and remote cleanup procedure without deleting anything.
   - Both commands remain safe to run without confirmation.

3. Implement local cleanup safety gates.
   - Require a command shape such as `tools/product-repository-cleanup local --confirm task-tracker-repository`.
   - Reject deletion when confirmation is missing or does not match the configured product repository name.
   - Reject deletion when the target path is inside the lesson repository.
   - Reject deletion when the target path is not the configured external product repository path.
   - Reject deletion when the target is not a Git repository, lacks `.git`, is not the Git top level, or cannot be identified safely.
   - Print a clear operation log before and after local deletion.

4. Implement remote cleanup safety gates.
   - Require a command shape such as `tools/product-repository-cleanup remote --confirm xxxMasahiro/task-tracker-repository`.
   - Require GitHub authentication and a successful remote repository lookup before any deletion attempt.
   - Show the owner/repository name and remote URL immediately before deletion.
   - Reject deletion when the confirmation text does not exactly match the full owner/repository name.
   - Print a clear operation log before and after remote deletion.

5. Keep destructive operations separated.
   - Do not add an `all` command.
   - Do not chain local and remote deletion automatically.
   - Do not infer deletion targets from loose user text.

6. Add mechanical validation.
   - Added `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh`.
   - Test status and plan behavior.
   - Test missing-confirmation and wrong-confirmation failures.
   - Test nested repository rejection.
   - Test non-Git target rejection.
   - Test local cleanup using temporary repositories only.
   - Test remote paths with fake `gh` behavior, never by deleting a real GitHub repository.
   - `tools/product-repository-cleanup` and `tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh` are required runtime artifacts.

7. Wire validation into existing checks.
   - Updated structure checks.
   - Updated as-built checks.
   - Updated developer-memory checks.
   - Added the new test to aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
   - Preserved existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-gate, Playwright, docs-tour, CI, and pre-commit behavior.

8. Synchronize related guidance after implementation.
   - Updated the five planning/workflow documents from planned to implemented state.
   - Updated `AGENTS.MD`, README/menu guidance, and dashboard output only where the cleanup command is part of runtime behavior.
   - Kept unrelated existing content unchanged.

9. Verify local, remote, and CI consistency.
   - Run the new cleanup test.
   - Run the existing lesson-side verification sequence.
   - Run pre-commit.
   - Commit and push only after all local checks pass.
   - Confirm `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` succeed for the pushed commit.
   - Confirm local HEAD, `origin/main`, and the CI target SHA match.

## Implemented As-Built Sync Contract Implementation Plan

This additive implementation strengthens mechanical enforcement across the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents.
It preserves existing checks and does not trade away any current 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, documentation-map, product-gate, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or developer-memory behavior.

1. Add a synchronization contract file.
   - Added `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv`.
   - Record each synchronized improvement with `sync_id`, `status`, `title`, `required_artifacts`, `required_tests`, `required_docs`, and `runtime_evidence`.
   - Keep the format simple enough for shell-based checks and future dashboard reuse.

2. Add matching sync blocks to the five synchronized documents.
   - Added `SYNC-ID`, `STATUS`, `ARTIFACTS`, and `TESTS` blocks to `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
   - Added the same blocks to `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md`.
   - Added the same blocks to `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
   - Added the same blocks to `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md`.
   - Added the same blocks to `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md`.
   - Preserved existing headings and narrative content; added contract metadata without deleting unrelated content.

3. Add a dedicated contract validator.
   - Added `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
   - Validate that every contract `sync_id` exists in all five documents.
   - Validate that no synchronized document contains a `SYNC-ID` block missing from the contract.
   - Validate that all five documents use the same `STATUS` for each `sync_id`.
   - Validate that document `ARTIFACTS` and `TESTS` blocks exactly match the contract without extra or missing entries.
   - Validate that required artifacts and required tests exist in the repository.
   - Validate that runtime evidence files exist and reference the sync ID, one of its artifacts, or one of its tests.
   - Validate that implemented sync IDs have their required tests actively wired into aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
   - Fail if a `planned` status and an `implemented` status are mixed for the same `sync_id`.

4. Preserve and extend existing checks.
   - Call the validator from `tools/check_as_built_docs.sh`.
   - Keep the current topic-based as-built checks as compatibility checks.
   - Keep `tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh` active for `TASK_TRACKER.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.
   - Do not replace existing checks with the new contract; make the contract an additional gate.

5. Add a status helper for learners and agents.
   - Added `tools/as-built-sync status`.
   - Show all sync IDs, current status, five-document coverage, artifact presence, and test-wiring status.
   - Keep output useful for both CLI learners and future dashboard reuse.

6. Add regression tests.
   - Added `tools/test_as_built_sync_contract.sh`.
   - Test a fully synchronized contract.
   - Test failure when one of the five documents lacks a sync block.
   - Test failure when a synchronized document contains an unknown sync ID.
   - Test failure when statuses are mixed across documents.
   - Test failure when a document contains extra artifacts or tests not listed in the contract.
   - Test failure when a required artifact is missing.
   - Test failure when an implemented required test is only mentioned as inert text or is not actively wired into aggregate tests, CI, or pre-commit.

7. Wire verification into existing gates after implementation.
   - Added the new test to `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
   - Added the validator and test to `.githooks/pre-commit`.
   - Added shell syntax and regression steps to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
   - Added shell syntax and regression steps to `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
   - Added `AGENTS.MD` routing and standard-check references for the sync-contract status and validator.
   - Updated runtime checks only where they became enforcement.
   - Run targeted checks, aggregate tests, pre-commit, and GitHub Actions before declaring implementation complete.

## Implemented Resource-Budgeted Parallel Guard Implementation Plan

This plan is synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
The runtime implementation is complete.
It preserves existing Git hooks modes, CI checks, pre-commit behavior, 7-day and 14-day lesson behavior, dashboard behavior, docs routes, and repository-boundary checks.

### Implemented Change Targets

- `docs/workflow/RESOURCE_POLICY.tsv`
- `learning/RESOURCE_SETTINGS.tsv`
- `tools/lib/resource_guard.sh`
- `tools/resource-guard`
- `tools/test_resource_guard.sh`
- `tools/git-hooks`
- `tools/test_lesson_playwright.sh`
- `playwright.config.js`
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`

### Implemented Order

1. Added policy and settings sources.
   - Keep warning thresholds, allowed modes, profile names, and default behavior in policy/settings files.
   - Keep the available-memory floor in both policy defaults and user settings.
   - Do not encode one-off fixed values directly in command branches.

2. Added a shared resource guard library.
   - Read memory, swap, disk free space, and active heavy-process signals where practical.
   - Calculate the effective swap budget from user-selected storage percentage and GiB upper limit.
   - Keep logic profile-based so Git hooks, Playwright, aggregate checks, and future checks can reuse it.
   - Reject unknown heavy-work profiles instead of silently falling back to a different profile.

3. Added a resource-guard command surface.
   - Commands include `status`, `check --profile`, `recommend-jobs --profile`, and `monitor --profile`.
   - Output must be suitable for learner-facing summaries and agent automation.
   - `check --profile` and `recommend-jobs --profile` fail closed at safe-stop while preserving serial fallback for caution states.
   - `parallel` mode is explicit and fails closed when caution states prevent safe parallelism.

4. Connected Git hooks without changing existing mode semantics.
   - Keep `minimal` lightweight.
   - Keep `full` as the complete local hook verification path.
   - Let heavy local checks consult the resource guard before optional parallel execution.
   - Preserve serial fallback when resource checks fail or enter a caution/block state.
   - Keep CI able to run the full Git hooks regression without inheriting local WSL resource settings.

5. Connected Playwright and aggregate checks conservatively.
   - Treat Playwright as heavy work.
   - Prefer one local worker unless resource checks explicitly allow more.
   - Do not allow uncontrolled overlap between Playwright, full hooks, and aggregate repository tests.
   - Route CI dashboard browser checks through the same Playwright wrapper used locally, and do not hide safe-stop failures.

6. Connected CI separately from local WSL resource policy.
   - Preserve all required CI checks.
   - Consider safe job separation and duplicate-run cancellation.
   - Do not treat CI runner resources as equivalent to local WSL resource settings.

7. Added standalone and aggregate tests.
   - Added `tools/test_resource_guard.sh`.
   - Wired it into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
   - Added calculation, threshold, active-heavy-process fallback, safe-stop failure code, invalid-setting, serial-mode, parallel-mode, and profile rejection tests.

8. Updated synchronized documentation after implementation.
   - Moved `resource_budget_parallel_guard` from `planned` to `implemented`.
   - Replaced the planned artifact/test list with implemented runtime files and active tests.
   - Kept all five synchronized documents and the sync contract aligned.

### Verification Commands

Run:

```bash
./tools/resource-guard status
./tools/resource-guard check --profile git-hooks-full
./tools/resource-guard recommend-jobs --profile playwright
./tools/test_resource_guard.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode minimal
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
.githooks/pre-commit
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
```

### Planned Recovery And Approval Rules

- If settings parsing fails, fix the TSV structure and add regression coverage.
- If thresholds are too strict or too loose, adjust policy data instead of adding hard-coded command branches.
- If Playwright becomes unstable, reduce worker count through resource recommendations and keep serial fallback.
- If CI diverges from local behavior, keep CI full and separate local resource policy from CI workflow structure.
- Developer approval is required before `.wslconfig` writes, swap creation/deletion, privileged cleanup, process killing, changing Git hooks mode semantics, weakening CI, weakening pre-commit, or introducing Docker/cgroups/systemd memory enforcement.

## Planned Learner Context Foundation Plan

This plan prepares the learner-facing context foundation only.
It does not implement runtime lesson rendering yet.
The next implementation plan should connect these files to lesson output, dashboards, prompts, and checks.

1. Add context source documents under `learning/context/`.
   - Add a directory README that explains the role of learner context and its synchronization boundary.
   - Add the main AI-driven development foundation text.
   - Add a staged security foundation.
   - Add a machine-readable context-to-lesson map.

2. Preserve source-language and display-language separation.
   - Keep repository source documents in English.
   - Let future runtime output translate or summarize according to the selected workflow display language.
   - Do not hard-code Japanese-only lesson text into runtime behavior from this documentation step.

3. Keep context separate from runtime implementation.
   - Do not modify lesson state machines in this step.
   - Do not change `tools/lesson`, `tools/lesson14`, dashboard behavior, or browser dashboard behavior in this step.
   - Mark the sync ID as `planned` until runtime integration and targeted checks are implemented.

4. Prepare future implementation connections.
   - Use `LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` as the future bridge from context topics to lesson openings, per-topic explanations, final recaps, security coverage, prompt examples, and dashboard candidates.
   - Use the main foundation and security foundation as the source for learner-mode-specific rendering.
   - Add future tests only when runtime integration is implemented.

5. Synchronize document discovery.
   - Update `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md` so learners and agents can find `learning/context/`.
   - Synchronize the planned context foundation through the as-built sync contract and the five synchronized documents.

## Planned Learner Context Runtime Integration Plan

This plan connects the existing learner-context foundation to runtime guidance.
It is not implemented yet.
The implementation must keep Free Development Mode as a workflow, not as a lesson.

### Planned Change Targets

- `learning/context/LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`
- planned new `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`
- planned new `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`
- planned new `tools/lesson-context`
- `tools/lesson`
- `tools/lesson14`
- `tools/team-development`
- `tools/free-development`
- `tools/product-improvement`
- `tools/external-integration`
- `tools/menu`
- `tools/dashboard`
- `guides/DOCUMENT_MAP.md`
- `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv`
- the three design/as-built documents and the two workflow-state documents

### Planned Implementation Order

1. Refine the learning context map.
   - Keep `LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` focused on learning contexts: 7-day lesson, 14-day lesson, and applied lesson.
   - Map opening context, per-step context, recap context, prompt examples, security markers, and dashboard candidates without relying on one hard-coded phrase.

2. Add a workflow context map.
   - Add `WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` for Free Development Mode, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson repository maintenance.
   - Keep workflow targets separate from lesson targets.
   - Make Free Development Mode a product-development workflow that applies the learned process.

3. Add a shared context library.
   - Add `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh`.
   - Reuse `tools/lib/lesson_common.sh` for learning mode, workflow display language, product development language, and common path handling.
   - Load maps generically so future topics can be added without one-off shell branches.

4. Add a standalone context CLI.
   - Add `tools/lesson-context status`.
   - Add `tools/lesson-context opening lesson-7|lesson-14|applied`.
   - Add `tools/lesson-context step lesson-7|lesson-14 <step_id>`.
   - Add `tools/lesson-context recap lesson-7|lesson-14|applied`.
   - Add `tools/lesson-context workflow free-development|product-improvement|external-integration|lesson-maintenance`.

5. Connect structured and applied learning.
   - Integrate context display into `tools/lesson`, `tools/lesson14`, and `tools/team-development`.
   - Preserve approval gates, ordered progression, learner-selected start positions, and current lesson state files.

6. Connect product-facing workflows.
   - Integrate workflow context into `tools/free-development`, `tools/product-improvement`, and `tools/external-integration`.
   - Show purpose, required documents, safety checks, and copy-paste prompts before product-facing work starts.
   - Preserve product repository boundary checks and Git workflow settings.

7. Connect menu and dashboard views.
   - Keep menu categories distinct: learning, building/extending, and lesson maintenance.
   - Show learning context and workflow context separately in dashboard output.

8. Add validation.
   - Add `tools/test_lesson_context.sh`.
   - Wire the new test into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`.
   - Keep the test runnable standalone and through aggregate checks.

9. Synchronize from planned to implemented only after runtime integration passes.
   - Update the sync-contract row artifacts and tests to the implemented runtime files.
   - Update all five synchronized documents from `planned` to `implemented`.
   - Keep unrelated content unchanged.

### Planned Verification

Run, after implementation:

```bash
./tools/lesson-context status
./tools/lesson-context opening lesson-7
./tools/lesson-context opening lesson-14
./tools/lesson-context opening applied
./tools/lesson-context workflow free-development
./tools/lesson-context workflow product-improvement
./tools/lesson-context workflow external-integration
./tools/test_lesson_context.sh
./tools/test_lesson.sh
./tools/test_lesson14.sh
./tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
```

CI and Lesson14 CI must also pass after push.

### Planned Failure Recovery

- If context map parsing fails, fix `tools/lesson-context` and `tools/lib/lesson_context.sh` before touching lesson commands.
- If lesson progression regresses, temporarily disconnect lesson command integration and keep the standalone context CLI stable.
- If Free Development Mode is displayed as a lesson, move that mapping to workflow context and correct menu/dashboard labels.
- If output is too verbose, adjust learning-mode display policy without rewriting the source context.
- If CI-only failures occur, compare CI logs with local full/no-cache verification and isolate environment-specific behavior.

### Developer Approval Points

- Whether to add columns to `LESSON_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` or keep additional binding data in separate TSV files.
- How broad `WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv` should be in its first implementation.
- How much context Free Development Mode should show before product work starts.
- Which workflow targets must always show security guidance.
- How much context should appear in CLI dashboard output before browser dashboard work begins.
- Whether runtime translation remains an agent facilitation instruction or a future translation dictionary is introduced.

## Implemented Git Workflow Policy Implementation Plan

This implementation lets users configure Git-management permissions and Git automation levels before the agent performs Git workflow operations.
It is additive and does not trade away existing 7-day, 14-day, menu, dashboard, Free Development, Product Improvement, external-integration, product-repository cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

1. Add policy and settings files.
   - Added `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv` as the policy definition.
   - Added `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv` as the current user-selected settings file.
   - Defined supported keys for working-branch permission, worktree permission, main-direct-work permission, and automation level.
   - Keep the file format simple and reusable for CLI tools, dashboard output, and future browser dashboard work.

2. Add a shared Git workflow policy library.
   - Added `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh`.
   - Load policy definitions and selected settings.
   - Validate setting keys and values.
   - Expose helpers for branch permission, worktree permission, main-direct-work permission, automation level, repository context, and Git monitoring.
   - Reuse existing repository-boundary, Git sync, and lesson-common patterns where practical.

3. Add a learner-facing command.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow status`.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow configure`.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow set <key> <value>`.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow allow <branch|worktree|main-direct|commit|push|pr|ci|sync>`.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow check`.
   - Added `tools/git-workflow cleanup-plan`.
   - Keep `cleanup-plan` non-destructive.

4. Define automation levels.
   - `manual`: provide guidance and monitoring only.
   - `commit`: allow automated commit after required checks pass.
   - `pr_ci`: allow automated push, PR creation where applicable, and CI checks.
   - `sync`: allow automated main CI checks plus local/remote synchronization checks.

5. Preserve explicit confirmation for high-impact operations.
   - Keep merge confirmation-gated.
   - Keep branch deletion confirmation-gated.
   - Keep worktree deletion confirmation-gated.
   - Keep remote deletion confirmation-gated.
   - Do not let automation level bypass destructive-operation confirmation.

6. Add Git monitoring.
   - Detect uncommitted changes.
   - Detect unpushed commits.
   - Detect local/remote divergence.
   - List candidate unnecessary working branches.
   - List candidate unnecessary worktrees.
   - Show whether the current repository is the lesson repository or product repository.
   - Separate lesson-repository Git state from product-repository Git state so the workflow cannot mix repositories.

7. Integrate with existing workflows.
   - Added menu and dashboard entry points without removing existing entries.
   - Keep the policy reusable for 7-day, 14-day, applied-learning, Free Development, product-improvement, and external-integration workflows.
   - Keep status paths non-blocking.
   - Enforce the policy only where a start, gate, check, or Git action actually depends on it.

8. Add tests.
   - Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh`.
   - Test valid setting changes.
   - Test invalid key and invalid value rejection.
   - Test branch and worktree permission decisions.
   - Test automation-level decisions.
   - Test dirty-state and local/remote sync monitoring.
   - Test lesson-repository and product-repository separation.
   - Test cleanup-plan output without deleting branches or worktrees.

9. Wire validation.
   - Added new files to structure checks.
   - Added policy checks to as-built checks.
   - Added `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` to aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit.
   - Preserve existing checks and avoid replacing current Git sync or CI checks.

10. Synchronize documentation.
   - Updated these five documents from planned to implemented state.
   - Updated `AGENTS.MD`, menu guidance, dashboard guidance, and runtime checks only where the runtime feature became active.
   - Keep unrelated existing content unchanged.

## Implemented Menu-Wide Git Workflow Policy Implementation Plan

This implementation promotes the existing Git workflow policy into a shared menu-level policy.
It is additive and does not trade away existing 7-day, 14-day, applied-learning, Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, lesson-maintenance, dashboard, product cleanup, CI, pre-commit, or as-built sync-contract behavior.

1. Preserve the existing Git policy source.
   - Keep `tools/git-workflow status|configure|set|allow|check|cleanup-plan` unchanged as the reusable policy command surface.
   - Reuse `docs/workflow/GIT_WORKFLOW_POLICY.tsv`, `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS.tsv`, and `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh`.

2. Add menu-level Git policy readiness.
   - Extended `tools/menu readiness` so menu items 1 through 7 show Git policy readiness.
   - Show branch permission, worktree permission, direct-main permission, automation level, and repository-monitor availability.

3. Extend menu checks without weakening existing prerequisites.
   - Added Git policy validation to menu items 1 through 6.
   - Keep current learning-mode, workflow display language, product development language, repository-boundary, and approval checks intact.
   - Keep `automation_level=manual` as a valid non-blocking setting.

4. Add a safe item 7 check/start path.
   - Added `tools/menu check 7`.
   - Added `tools/menu start 7 --confirm`.
   - Treat item 7 as lesson-repository maintenance and use lesson repository Git context.

5. Interpret automation levels consistently by menu item.
   - `manual`: guidance and monitoring only.
   - `commit`: commit-level automation only after required checks pass.
   - `pr_ci`: push, PR, and CI-check automation where applicable.
   - `sync`: main synchronization plus local/remote sync checks where applicable.

6. Preserve explicit confirmation for destructive Git actions.
   - Do not let menu-level policy bypass merge confirmation.
   - Do not let menu-level policy bypass branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, or product repository cleanup confirmation.

7. Update dashboard visibility.
   - Added a menu-wide Git policy summary to dashboard output.
   - Preserve existing lesson, docs, development, illustration, and menu readiness dashboard sections.

8. Add or update tests.
   - Extended `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` for item 1 through 7 Git policy readiness and checks.
   - Keep `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` focused on the reusable Git policy command itself.
   - Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, CI, and pre-commit wiring additive.

9. Synchronize documentation.
   - Updated these five documents from planned to implemented after runtime implementation exists and tests pass.
   - Updated `AGENTS.MD`, menu guidance, and dashboard guidance only where the runtime feature became active.
   - Keep unrelated existing content unchanged.

10. Verify with mechanical checks.
   - Run as-built sync-contract checks.
   - Run menu prerequisite tests.
   - Run Git workflow policy tests.
   - Run aggregate lesson-repository tests.
   - Run pre-commit and GitHub Actions before declaring implementation complete.

## Implemented Git Workflow Action Settings Implementation Plan

This implemented work adds detailed manual/automatic controls for common Git workflow actions.
It must preserve existing Git policy settings, menu checks, dashboard output, cleanup controls, CI checks, pre-commit, and the as-built sync contract.

1. Preserve existing policy compatibility.
   - Keep `branch_allowed`, `worktree_allowed`, `main_direct_work_allowed`, and `automation_level`.
   - Keep `automation_level` available as a compatibility preset.
   - Do not remove or rename existing `tools/git-workflow` commands.

2. Extend the Git workflow policy definition.
   - Add these detailed keys to the policy definition:
     - `commit_automation`
     - `push_automation`
     - `pr_creation`
     - `pr_ci_monitoring`
     - `merge_execution`
     - `developer_auto_merge_allowed`
     - `main_ci_monitoring`
     - `sync_monitoring`
   - Allow only `manual|auto` for non-merge action keys.
   - Allow only `manual|after_approval` for `merge_execution`.
   - Allow only `false|true` for `developer_auto_merge_allowed`.
   - Use these defaults:
     - `commit_automation: auto`
     - `push_automation: manual`
     - `pr_creation: manual`
     - `pr_ci_monitoring: auto`
     - `merge_execution: after_approval`
     - `developer_auto_merge_allowed: false`
     - `main_ci_monitoring: auto`
     - `sync_monitoring: auto`
   - These detailed defaults are active after implementation; `automation_level` remains available as a compatibility preset when detailed action keys are absent.

3. Add shared resolution helpers.
   - Add `git_workflow_action_mode <action>` to `tools/lib/git_workflow_policy.sh`.
   - Supported actions: `commit`, `push`, `pr`, `ci`, `pr_ci`, `merge`, `main_ci`, and `sync`.
   - Keep `ci` as a compatibility alias for CI monitoring so existing `tools/git-workflow allow ci` behavior is not removed.
   - Resolve merge as `manual`, `after_approval`, or `developer_auto`.
   - Resolve `developer_auto` only when `developer_auto_merge_allowed=true` and all merge safety gates pass.
   - Detailed settings take precedence only when the detailed setting key is present.
   - Fall back to `automation_level` when a detailed setting key is absent.

4. Update the learner-facing Git command output.
   - Update `tools/git-workflow status` to show detailed action settings.
   - Update `tools/git-workflow configure` with copyable `set` examples for all detailed settings.
   - Keep `tools/git-workflow set <key> <value>` as the single write path.
   - Add `tools/git-workflow approve <push|pr|merge> "memo"` as the explicit approval write path for high-impact detailed Git actions.

5. Update menu and dashboard visibility.
   - Show detailed action settings in `tools/menu readiness`.
   - Show detailed action settings in `tools/dashboard menu`.
   - Apply the same settings to menu items 1 through 7.

6. Preserve manual confirmation for high-impact actions.
   - For push and PR creation, `auto` means the agent may execute the operation only after explicit approval for that operation is recorded; it never means approval-free execution.
   - For normal merge operation, `merge_execution: after_approval` means the agent may execute merge only after explicit merge approval is recorded.
   - Require matching action, repository, and branch approval receipts from `learning/GIT_WORKFLOW_APPROVALS.tsv` before detailed push, PR creation, or normal merge execution is allowed.
   - Added `developer_auto_merge_allowed: true` as the only implemented path for developer-responsibility approval-free merge.
   - Require gate evidence plus actual repository checks before developer auto-merge: PR CI success, clear target PR and branch, verified merge base, clean working tree, checked local/remote state, and stop-on-failure behavior.
   - Keep branch deletion, worktree deletion, remote deletion, and product repository deletion behind explicit user confirmation regardless of merge settings.
   - Keep PR CI, main CI, and sync monitoring automatic by default.

7. Add tests.
   - Extend `tools/test_git_workflow_policy.sh` for defaults, changes, invalid values, detailed precedence, approval receipts, and helper resolution.
   - Extend `tools/test_menu_prerequisites.sh` for detailed settings in menu readiness.
   - Extend dashboard coverage so `tools/dashboard menu` exposes detailed settings.
   - Keep aggregate lesson-repository, pre-commit, and CI wiring additive.

8. Synchronize implemented documentation.
   - Moved `git_workflow_action_settings` from `planned` to `implemented`.
   - Replaced `ARTIFACTS: none` and `TESTS: none` with the implemented artifacts and tests.
   - Updated these five synchronized documents and the sync contract together.

## Implemented Git Hooks Policy Implementation Plan

This implementation makes `.githooks/pre-commit` faster while preserving the current safety model.
The work is implemented through runtime artifacts, tests, and the `git_hooks_policy` sync record.

1. Preserve the current safety baseline.
   - Kept the existing `.githooks/pre-commit` check list as the functional baseline in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`.
   - Do not add a normal learner-facing `off` mode.
   - Keep CI and completion verification full or no-cache.
   - Do not remove existing checks, CI steps, sync-contract checks, or documentation routes.

2. Define a reusable policy and settings layer.
   - Added `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOKS_POLICY.tsv`.
   - Added `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`.
   - Added `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`.
   - Added `learning/GIT_HOOK_SETTINGS.tsv`.
   - Added shared shell helpers in `tools/lib/git_hooks_policy.sh`.
   - Kept mode names and accepted values centralized so future tools, dashboard output, repo-local skills, and tests can reuse the same source.

3. Add a hook runner command.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks status`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks recommend`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks recommend --paths <path>...`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks mode <full|fast|minimal>`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks cache clear`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks run`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks run --no-cache`.
   - Added `tools/git-hooks run --mode <full|fast|minimal>`.
   - Keep output learner-readable and suitable for agents to summarize.

4. Implement conservative caching.
   - Store cache data under an untracked Git-local directory such as `.git/pre-commit-cache/`.
   - Include hook mode, command identity, relevant tool hashes, relevant input hashes, staged content, worktree changes, and Git status data.
   - Disable cache use while untracked files are present.
   - Treat missing, stale, corrupted, or unverifiable cache entries as misses.
   - Never allow a cache hit to replace full/no-cache CI verification.

5. Define mode behavior.
   - `full` runs coverage equivalent to the current required pre-commit checks.
   - `fast` uses the cache to avoid rerunning checks only when prior successful inputs still match.
   - `minimal` runs a small required mechanical set for quick local feedback.
   - Future changes to the minimal-mode check list require developer approval because it defines the lowest acceptable local safety gate.

6. Add local full/no-cache recommendation behavior.
   - Keep the selected local hook mode, such as `minimal`, as the default local pre-commit behavior.
   - Keep remote CI and final verification on full/no-cache coverage.
   - Recommend local `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache` only when changed paths match the recommendation policy for Git hooks, CI, checks, tests, or as-built synchronization.
   - Keep the recommendation policy in `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` instead of hard-coding one-off branches in the runner.

7. Connect to existing ecosystem surfaces.
   - Updated `.githooks/pre-commit` to call `tools/git-hooks run`.
   - Wired the dedicated hook test into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
   - Added CI coverage for the hook test and for full/no-cache behavior.
   - Added AGENTS routing and standard-check references for the hook command and test.
   - Updated existing wiring checks and status output so runner-based hook dispatch is recognized as active pre-commit wiring against full-mode coverage, independent of the current local hook mode.

8. Add standalone and aggregate tests.
   - Added `tools/test_git_hooks.sh` for modes, invalid mode rejection, invalid persisted settings, malformed check rows, invalid or empty check-row mode tokens, cache hits, cache misses, invalidation, no-cache operation, minimal-mode required checks, failing-check cache refusal, and safe cache clearing.
   - Added recommendation tests that confirm ordinary changed files keep the local recommendation at `minimal`, while Git hooks, CI, checks, tests, or as-built synchronization paths recommend local `full --no-cache`.
   - Confirm existing pre-commit checks still run in `full` through `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`.
   - Confirm aggregate tests, CI, and pre-commit include the new hook validation after implementation.
   - Confirm existing 7-day, 14-day, Git workflow policy, menu, dashboard, docs-tour, product cleanup, sync-contract, and CI behavior remains available.

9. Plan recovery behavior.
   - If a cache bug is suspected, clear the cache and rerun with `--no-cache`.
   - If hook-runner integration fails, restore the current serial `.githooks/pre-commit` command list while preserving the new tests for diagnosis.
   - If minimal-mode scope conflicts with safety expectations, stop for developer approval.
   - If CI behavior diverges from local hooks, keep CI on full/no-cache verification and fix local runner behavior.

10. Synchronize after implementation.
   - Moved `git_hooks_policy` from `planned` to `implemented`.
   - Replaced `ARTIFACTS: none` and `TESTS: none` with the implemented files and tests.
   - Updated these five synchronized documents and `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` together.
   - Keep unrelated existing content unchanged.

## Verification Plan

Run:

```bash
./tools/check_lesson_structure.sh
./tools/check_lesson14_structure.sh
./tools/check_lesson14_sync.sh
./tools/check_agents_skills.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/check_review_protocol.sh
./tools/check_developer_memory_requirements.sh
./tools/menu

./tools/test_lesson.sh
./tools/test_lesson14.sh
./tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh
./tools/test_product_repository_cleanup.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
```

Run `./tools/test_production_operations.sh` only when an external product repository is intentionally present.

The verification sequence also includes document-organization, workflow-pair synchronization, strengthened as-built synchronization, external-integration, Playwright, CI/pre-commit, and failure-path tests introduced by this plan.

Implemented local verification for the 7-day parity change passed:

```text
7-day lesson CLI tests passed.
Lesson14 CLI tests passed.
Lesson repository test passed.
```

The same verification covers the expanded language list and confirms `zh` is normalized to `zh-CN`.

## Implemented Resource Guard Safe Cleanup Implementation Plan

This plan was synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md` and implemented as `resource_guard_safe_cleanup`.
It is a follow-up capability to `resource_budget_parallel_guard`, not a replacement for the existing resource monitoring and fail-closed behavior.

### Implemented Change Targets

- `docs/workflow/RESOURCE_POLICY.tsv`
- `learning/RESOURCE_SETTINGS.tsv`
- `tools/lib/resource_guard.sh`
- `tools/resource-guard`
- `tools/test_resource_cleanup.sh`
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`
- `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`

### Implemented Order

1. Synchronized the safe cleanup plan into the five as-built and workflow documents.
   - Added `resource_guard_safe_cleanup` to `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv`.
   - Kept `resource_budget_parallel_guard` implemented and unchanged as the parent resource-control capability.

2. Extended resource policy and settings.
   - Added cleanup defaults for safe deletion, age filtering, and explicit safe-delete requirements.
   - Added policy-owned cleanup targets for Playwright report output, Playwright test results, and marked Git hooks cache.
   - Kept cleanup targets data-driven instead of embedding target lists in command branches.

3. Added shared cleanup helpers to `tools/lib/resource_guard.sh`.
   - Validate cleanup target paths.
   - Resolve paths under the lesson repository root.
   - Reject path traversal, absolute paths, symlink targets, unsafe `.git` targets, and repo-boundary escape.
   - Require the Git hooks cache marker before deleting `.git/pre-commit-cache`.
   - Apply optional age filtering before deletion.

4. Added `tools/resource-guard cleanup`.
   - Default action is dry-run.
   - `--safe` is required for deletion.
   - `--profile` filters cleanup targets by reusable profile.
   - `--older-than` overrides the configured age filter for one command.

5. Added standalone cleanup tests.
   - Added `tools/test_resource_cleanup.sh`.
   - Tests use temporary fixture repositories and do not depend on the product repository or local Playwright artifacts.
   - Tests cover dry-run, safe deletion, profile filtering, age filtering, symlink rejection, repo-outside rejection, unknown profile rejection, disabled safe cleanup, and Git hooks cache marker enforcement.

6. Connected cleanup regression to existing verification surfaces.
   - Wired cleanup tests into `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`.
   - Added cleanup regression to `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`.
   - Added shell syntax and regression steps to both GitHub Actions workflows.

### Recovery Plan

- If dry-run deletes anything, stop and disable cleanup execution until planning is fixed.
- If a repo-outside path is accepted, stop and fix path validation before continuing.
- If a symlink escape is possible, disable safe deletion and repair boundary checks.
- If Git hooks cache cleanup fails, keep `tools/git-hooks cache clear` as the existing recovery path and repair marker validation.
- If Playwright reports are needed for debugging, use dry-run or age filtering rather than deleting them immediately.
- If CI diverges from local behavior, keep CI cleanup checks fixture-based and non-destructive outside temporary test directories.

## Implemented Resource Guard Summary And Parallel CI Implementation Plan

This implementation was synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md` as `resource_guard_summary_parallel_ci`.
It is a follow-up to the implemented resource guard, Git hooks policy, and safe cleanup work.
It must not replace existing `status`, `monitor`, `recommend-jobs`, `check`, `cleanup`, Git hooks modes, CI checks, pre-commit behavior, or lesson flows.

### Implemented Change Targets

- `tools/resource-guard`
- `tools/lib/resource_guard.sh`
- `tools/lib/git_hooks_policy.sh`
- `tools/git-hooks`
- `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml`
- `tools/test_resource_guard_summary.sh`
- `tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh`
- `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh`
- Existing aggregate and hook wiring in `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, and CI workflows.

### Implemented Order

1. Synchronized the plan into the five as-built/workflow documents and added the sync contract row.
2. Added resource guard summary helpers that read profiles from `docs/workflow/RESOURCE_POLICY.tsv` and reuse `resource_guard_recommended_jobs`.
3. Added `tools/resource-guard summary` and `tools/resource-guard summary --short`.
4. Added standalone summary regression tests with fixture policy/settings files.
5. Added `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv` for parallel-safe, serial, heavy, and final-gate classification without changing the existing `GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` contract.
6. Added local Git hooks parallel runner support that uses the `git-hooks-full` recommendation as the maximum worker count for parallel-safe checks.
7. Kept minimal mode conservative and serial.
8. Added isolated per-check logging and deterministic replay in check definition order.
9. Added Git hooks parallel regression tests for worker limits, serial fallback, failure reporting, output order, and unclassified serial fallback.
10. Split GitHub Actions workflows into runner-oriented jobs while preserving all existing checks.
11. Added required CI workflow structure checks to verify required job names, `needs`, and required commands.
12. Ensured the final CI `aggregate-and-full-hooks` job installs npm dependencies and Playwright dependencies before running aggregate repository tests or full hooks.
13. Preserved explicit local/CI separation, including CI-safe local-resource bypass behavior with `RESOURCE_GUARD_SKIP_LOCAL_CHECK=1` for CI full hooks.
14. Wired new tests into aggregate, pre-commit, and CI.
15. Updated `docs/workflow/AS_BUILT_SYNC_CONTRACT.tsv` from planning-only artifacts and tests to actual runtime artifacts, runtime tests, and runtime evidence.
16. Moved the sync ID from `planned` to `implemented` after runtime artifacts and tests existed locally.

### Verification Plan

Verification commands:

```bash
bash -n tools/resource-guard tools/lib/resource_guard.sh tools/lib/git_hooks_policy.sh tools/git-hooks
./tools/resource-guard summary
./tools/resource-guard summary --short
./tools/test_resource_guard_summary.sh
./tools/test_resource_guard.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh
./tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode minimal --no-cache
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
.githooks/pre-commit
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
```

Optional verification:

```bash
./tools/test_lesson_playwright.sh
```

Remote CI verification should use GitHub Actions run status or PR checks after the workflow split is pushed.

### Recovery Plan

- If summary output diverges from `status` or `recommend-jobs`, fix summary helper reuse rather than duplicating calculations.
- If local parallel hooks fail due to ordering or shared state, classify the affected check as serial and keep the rest of the parallel-safe group intact.
- If logs interleave, keep per-check logs and replay order as the required baseline.
- If resource guard returns `safe-stop`, stop new parallel work instead of forcing worker execution.
- If CI job splitting drops an existing check, restore the check before pursuing runtime improvement.
- If CI job splitting becomes ambiguous, pause for developer approval rather than weakening verification.

### Developer Approval Gates

- Approval is required before changing the meaning of `full`, `fast`, or `minimal`.
- Approval is required before directly changing the `GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv` column structure.
- Approval is required before making Playwright or aggregate checks more aggressively parallel than resource guard recommends.
- Approval is required before reducing duplicate CI coverage for speed.
- Approval is required before adding a CI-specific settings file if the workflow structure alone is insufficient.

## Implemented SafeFlow Security Backfill Implementation Plan

This implementation is synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
The sync ID is implemented because runtime artifacts, tests, Git hooks wiring, CI wiring, and pre-commit wiring are present.

### Implemented Scope

- Added a SafeFlow security backfill sync scope that is separate from learner-context runtime integration.
- Added repository-level security invariants to the agent rule layer.
- Added `docs/workflow/SAFEFLOW_SECURITY_BACKFILL.tsv` as a policy table for security surfaces, invariants, evidence, required checks, and status.
- Added `tools/lib/security_invariants.sh`, `tools/check_security_invariants.sh`, and `tools/test_security_invariants.sh`.
- Wired the checker into aggregate tests, Git hooks, CI, and pre-commit.

### Implemented Order

1. Added the policy table with a small schema rather than overbuilding severity or owner routing.
2. Added the reusable security-invariant checker and regression test.
3. Added Git hooks recommendation paths and hook checks after the checker existed.
4. Wired standalone, sync, aggregate, Git hooks, pre-commit, and CI verification.
5. Moved `safeflow_security_backfill` from planned to implemented after runtime artifacts and tests passed locally.

### Verification

```bash
./tools/check_security_invariants.sh
./tools/test_security_invariants.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode minimal --no-cache
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
.githooks/pre-commit
```

### Recovery

- If the checker creates false positives, adjust policy categories or allowlists instead of adding one-off bypasses.
- If a proposed invariant conflicts with existing behavior, stop and ask for developer approval.
- If a security check requires network access, separate it from pre-commit and local non-network verification.

## Implemented Product Security Workflow Gate Implementation Plan

This implementation is synchronized from `docs/memory/DEVELOPER_MEMORY.md`.
The sync ID is implemented because product-security runtime commands, policy, tests, and menu/workflow wiring exist.

### Implemented Scope

- Added product-security advice, check, and gate behavior for menu items 4, 5, and 6.
- Keep existing Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, repository-boundary, Git sync, CI, and document-sync gates.
- Added product security policy configuration instead of hard-coded stack-specific branches.
- Added workflow-context risk metadata for Free Development, Product Improvement, External Integration, and lesson maintenance.
- Added dashboard and menu safety summaries that explain next safe action, what not to touch, and what requires approval.

### Implemented Order

1. Added `docs/workflow/PRODUCT_SECURITY_POLICY.tsv` and `learning/context/WORKFLOW_CONTEXT_MAP.tsv`.
2. Added `tools/lib/product_security.sh` as the reusable product-security library.
3. Added `tools/product-security status|preflight|advise|check|gate`.
4. Added `tools/test_product_security.sh` using temporary product repositories and fixture policies.
5. Connected the product-security gate to menu items 4, 5, and 6 without replacing existing gates.
6. Strengthened External Integration start/preflight prompts to require explicit OAuth/API and logging confirmation.
7. Added product-repository context handling after the product repository is known.
8. Wired tests into aggregate tests, Git hooks, CI, and pre-commit.
9. Moved `product_security_workflow_gate` from planned to implemented after runtime artifacts and tests passed locally.

### Verification

```bash
./tools/product-security status
./tools/product-security preflight
./tools/product-security check
./tools/test_product_security.sh
./tools/test_product_gate_tools.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_workflow_pair_sync.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode minimal --no-cache
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
.githooks/pre-commit
```

### Recovery

- If the gate blocks too much, split high-confidence blocks from warnings instead of weakening all security checks.
- If a stack-specific check is needed, put the detection and command mapping in policy or reusable library code.
- If product repository context is ambiguous, stop and require user confirmation instead of scanning outside the configured repository.

### Developer Approval Gates

- Future approval is required before expanding AGENTS.MD security-invariant wording beyond the implemented additive rule.
- Future approval is required before adding new product-security blocking conditions.
- Future approval is required before making External Integration approvals mandatory beyond the implemented OAuth/API and logging scope.
- Approval is required before enabling network-dependent audits such as `npm audit` in CI.
- Approval is required before adding product repository cleanup strengthening to this implementation instead of a later sync scope.

## Implemented Test And CI Safe Time Optimization Implementation

This plan is synchronized as `test_ci_safe_time_optimization_plan`.
The implemented first phase keeps runtime test selection, CI required behavior, pre-commit behavior, and Git hook mode semantics intact while adding observe-only planning, fail-closed coverage checks, result attestation, CI-safe Git hooks parallelism, and lightweight fixture copying.

### Implemented Change Targets

- `docs/workflow/TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv` stores machine-readable observe-only test-plan policy.
- `tools/lib/test_plan.sh` and `tools/test-plan` implement changed-path classification, manifest generation, coverage validation, and result attestation.
- `tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh` and `tools/test_test_plan.sh` provide standalone and aggregate-callable checks.
- `tools/git-hooks` accepts `--jobs <count>` and `GIT_HOOKS_JOBS` while local execution remains capped by resource guard recommendations.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml` keep full/no-cache verification and request CI-safe full-hooks parallelism with `--jobs 4`.
- `tools/lib/fixture_copy.sh`, `tools/fixture-copy`, and `tools/test_fixture_copy.sh` implement and validate lightweight fixture copying.
- `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, and `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh` wire the new checks into existing local, aggregate, Git hooks, and CI gates.

### Implemented Order And Preserved Future Work

1. Added a Test Plan Manifest in observe-only mode.
   - Generate `run` and `force` decisions without changing actual CI enforcement.
   - Print learner-readable decision and full-escalation reasons.
   - Treat unknown paths and dangerous paths as full/no-cache until classified.

2. Added Coverage Guard.
   - Fail closed when policy rows are malformed, reference unknown Git hook checks, omit required dangerous-change patterns, weaken required dangerous-change full/CI escalation, or emit a force decision without full escalation.
   - Keep CI/pre-commit wiring verification in the CI workflow structure checker.
   - Add tests that prove unsafe changed-only decisions fail before any CI skipping is allowed.

3. Added Result Attestation.
   - Record policy hash, check-catalog hash, repository-state hash, manifest hash, generated run/force decisions, and final observe-only authority.
   - Keep attestation as evidence, not as approval or proof of delivery.

4. Connected observe-only checks to local hooks, aggregate tests, and CI.
   - Local `minimal`, `fast`, and `full` run the coverage guard through the configured hook catalog.
   - CI runs the coverage guard and test-plan regression while still running the existing required full verification.

5. Kept the hook-specific gap-only final gate as future work.
   - Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` as the standalone exhaustive aggregate command.
   - In full hooks, replace duplicate aggregate reruns only after a mechanical coverage check proves that individual hook rows plus the gap gate cover the standalone aggregate expectations.

6. Kept as-built validation single-pass behavior as future work.
   - Keep strict standalone defaults.
   - Add internal-only options only after tests prove callers already ran `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` once in the same path.

7. Kept Playwright duplicate-execution removal as future work.
   - Keep Playwright as required local/CI verification where relevant.
   - Ensure CI final aggregation checks Playwright evidence rather than rerunning the browser suite.

8. Added CI-safe hook parallelism.
   - Keep `--mode full --no-cache`.
   - Add an explicit CI worker setting through `--jobs` or `GIT_HOOKS_JOBS`.
   - Do not use local WSL resource settings as CI truth.

9. Reduced fixture-copy cost.
   - Add a shared fixture-copy helper that excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, and cache directories.
   - Require any test fixture that depends on untracked files to declare those files explicitly.

10. Kept changed-only selection observe-only.
    - Compare planned changed-only output against full CI results.
    - Do not let changed-only skip CI checks until Coverage Guard and Result Attestation are implemented and have sufficient passing evidence.

### Document Synchronization Policy

- `docs/as-built/REQUIREMENTS.md` describes the guarantees and non-goals.
- `docs/as-built/SPECIFICATION.md` describes manifest, guard, attestation, cache, CI, and quarantine behavior.
- `docs/as-built/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` describes implementation order, recovery, and approval gates.
- `docs/workflow/TASK_TRACKER.md` records implemented task state and preserved future work.
- `docs/workflow/HANDOFF.md` records restart context, risks, future approval gates, and next steps.
- The sync ID is implemented because runtime artifacts, standalone tests, aggregate wiring, CI wiring, and pre-commit behavior are present and verified for the safe first phase.

### Verification Plan

Implemented verification:

```bash
bash -n tools/test-plan tools/lib/test_plan*.sh tools/lib/fixture_copy.sh tools/fixture-copy tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh tools/test_test_plan.sh tools/test_fixture_copy.sh
./tools/test_test_plan.sh
./tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh
./tools/test_fixture_copy.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh
./tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/as-built-sync status
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode minimal --no-cache
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache
.githooks/pre-commit
```

### Recovery Plan

- If Test Plan Manifest output is wrong, keep it observe-only and fix policy classification before changing execution behavior.
- If Coverage Guard blocks valid work, fix the manifest or impact map; do not bypass the guard with ad hoc path exceptions.
- If attestation is incomplete, keep full CI authoritative and repair evidence generation.
- If same-run cache creates stale reuse, disable reuse and keep full/no-cache execution until hash inputs are corrected.
- If gap-only final gate misses aggregate coverage, restore the standalone aggregate in full hooks and repair the mechanical coverage check.
- If CI workflow consolidation changes required check names, pause for developer approval and branch-protection migration planning.

### Developer Approval Gates

- Approval is required before making changed-only selection authoritative in CI.
- Approval is required before changing required CI check names or consolidating `ci.yml` and `lesson14-ci.yml` in a way that affects branch protection.
- Approval is required before reducing full/no-cache scope.
- Approval is required before adding flaky quarantine.
- Approval is required before changing the meaning of `full`, `fast`, or `minimal`.
- Approval is required before using persistent verification-result cache in CI.

## Implemented Test And CI Final Gate Optimization Implementation Plan

This plan is synchronized as `test_ci_final_gate_optimization_plan`.
It is implemented as the completed test and CI time optimization work for reducing the current long `aggregate-and-full-hooks` runtime without reducing coverage.

### Planned Change Targets

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml` for dependency caching, same-run evidence handoff, and common-versus-Lesson14 final-gate separation.
- `docs/workflow/TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv` and `docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_COVERAGE.tsv` for cache-scope, aggregate coverage, and final-gate policy alignment.
- `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`, and `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv` for hook catalog and final-gate coverage mapping.
- `tools/git-hooks` and shared Git hook policy code for full-mode gap-only final-gate dispatch.
- `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` as the standalone exhaustive aggregate command that must remain available.
- `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh` for mechanical enforcement of the optimized CI shape.
- New implementation-specific checks and tests for gap-only coverage, same-run evidence reuse, Playwright evidence reuse, and as-built evidence reuse.

### Planned Implementation Order

1. Add same-run evidence primitives.
   - Define a repo-local or workflow-local evidence directory.
   - Record command ID, commit SHA, workflow name, job name, policy hash, check catalog hash, input hashes, result hash, and timestamp.
   - Reject evidence that is missing, stale, corrupted, mismatched, or from a different command identity.

2. Add as-built and sync evidence reuse.
   - Generate evidence from strict as-built and sync checks.
   - Reuse evidence only inside the same command or CI run when synchronized document hashes, sync-contract hash, checker hashes, and repository-state hash match.
   - Keep strict standalone commands unchanged.

3. Add Playwright evidence reuse.
   - Generate evidence from the `playwright-tests` job.
   - Final aggregation checks evidence instead of rerunning Playwright when config, test files, dependency lockfile, command identity, commit SHA, workflow run, source job identity, and result status match.
   - Rerun or fail closed when evidence cannot be trusted.

4. Add hook-specific gap-only final gate.
   - Keep `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` as the exhaustive command.
   - Replace the full hook's duplicate aggregate rerun with a final gate that proves individual hook rows plus explicit final-gap checks cover the aggregate expectations.
   - Add a standalone coverage map and test proving the gate fails when any aggregate requirement is uncovered.

5. Reduce common CI duplication between `CI` and `Lesson14 CI`.
   - Keep required workflow names unless developer approval is granted to change them.
   - Move common heavy verification into one common path where possible.
   - Keep Lesson14-specific structure and CLI checks in `Lesson14 CI` through a Lesson14-specific final gate instead of the common aggregate/full-hooks gate.
   - If branch-protection constraints require both workflows to report, reduce duplicate internals without renaming checks.
   - Keep the legacy `Lesson14 CI` `playwright-tests` and `aggregate-and-full-hooks` job names as compatibility gates that do not duplicate browser execution, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, or `tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache`.
   - Extend Git hook recommendation paths so final-gate coverage, final-gate commands, same-run evidence, and as-built evidence implementation changes recommend local `full --no-cache`.

6. Add dependency caching.
   - Use GitHub Actions npm dependency caching.
   - Add Playwright browser dependency caching where safe for hosted runners.
   - Never restore verification-result cache from earlier commits or workflow runs.

7. Extend cleanup and cache management.
   - Include same-run evidence, Playwright reports, test results, temporary fixtures, and repo-local cache directories.
   - Keep global caches, OS caches, Docker, swap, processes, product repositories, and user-home cleanup out of scope without explicit approval.

8. Update mechanical enforcement.
   - Extend CI structure checks to require the optimized final-gate shape.
   - Keep new tests standalone and callable from aggregate tests.
   - Keep `TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv` cache-scope policy aligned with implemented behavior.

### Document Synchronization Policy

- Requirements describe the guarantees, non-goals, and approval gates.
- Specification describes same-run evidence validity, cache boundaries, and fail-closed behavior.
- Implementation plan describes change order, validation, recovery, and approval points.
- Task tracker records the implemented work and final verification state.
- Handoff records restart instructions and the next implementation boundary.
- The as-built sync contract is `implemented` because the runtime artifacts and tests exist, are wired, and are expected to pass.

### Verification Plan

The implementation must add and pass these checks before the sync ID can become `implemented`:

```bash
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh
./tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh
./tools/test_test_plan.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh
./tools/test_resource_cleanup.sh
./tools/test_lesson_start_position.sh
./tools/test_lesson14.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
./tools/git-hooks run --mode full --no-cache --jobs 4
.githooks/pre-commit
```

The implementation must also add focused tests for:

- gap-only final-gate coverage,
- same-run evidence reuse and stale-evidence rejection,
- Playwright evidence reuse and changed-input rejection,
- as-built evidence reuse and changed-document rejection,
- CI dependency cache wiring,
- cleanup coverage for same-run evidence and generated reports.

### Recovery Plan

- If gap-only final gate misses coverage, restore the duplicate aggregate rerun in full hooks and fix the coverage map.
- If same-run evidence is stale or ambiguous, disable evidence reuse for that command and rerun the strict check.
- If Playwright evidence cannot be trusted, rerun Playwright rather than passing on incomplete evidence.
- If as-built evidence mismatches input hashes, rerun strict as-built checks.
- If dependency caching causes CI-only failures, remove the cache step or narrow the cache key.
- If CI workflow consolidation affects required check names, stop and request developer approval.

### Developer Approval Gates

- Approval is required before changing required CI workflow or job names.
- Approval is required before reducing full/no-cache scope.
- Approval is required before making changed-only CI selection authoritative.
- Approval is required before reusing verification results across workflow runs or commits.

## Implemented Test And CI Full Pipeline Acceleration Implementation Plan

This plan is synchronized as `test_ci_full_pipeline_acceleration_plan`.
Runtime behavior is implemented through policy files, focused regression checks, CI workflow structure checks, and workflow wiring.
The purpose is to complete the remaining local and remote test/CI speed work after the final-gate evidence-reuse implementation, without weakening any required check or existing workflow.

### Implemented Change Targets

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/lesson14-ci.yml` for GitHub Actions deprecation handling, Playwright setup optimization, job separation, duplicate-policy regression reduction, and CI-runner-oriented parallelism.
- `docs/workflow/TEST_PLAN_MANIFEST.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_CHECKS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_PARALLEL_GROUPS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/GIT_HOOK_RECOMMENDATION_PATHS.tsv`, `docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_GAP_COMMANDS.tsv`, and `docs/workflow/FINAL_GATE_COVERAGE.tsv` for machine-readable check ownership, risk, cache scope, parallel grouping, and final-gate coverage policy.
- `tools/git-hooks`, `tools/lib/git_hooks_policy.sh`, `tools/lib/resource_guard.sh`, `tools/ci-final-gate`, `tools/ci-evidence`, `tools/lib/ci_evidence.sh`, and `tools/lib/as_built_evidence.sh` for local execution, evidence validation, same-run reuse, and resource-aware behavior.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh`, `tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh`, `tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh`, `tools/test_ci_evidence.sh`, `tools/test_ci_final_gate.sh`, `tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh`, and `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh` for mechanical verification.
- `tools/ci-playwright-setup` and `tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh` for cache-aware Playwright setup and focused acceleration regression coverage.
- Future implementation candidates such as `tools/ci-metrics` or additional focused tests may be added only when they are generic, reusable, standalone-testable, aggregate-testable, and synchronized into the contract after creation.

### Implemented Steps

1. GitHub Actions deprecation regressions are mechanically guarded first.
   - Required workflow/job meanings are preserved.
   - CI workflow structure checks reject old major action versions and `continue-on-error: true`.

2. Playwright setup is optimized.
   - `tools/ci-playwright-setup` prefers npm cache reuse and checks whether Chromium is already installed.
   - Playwright execution is preserved and setup falls back to normal install behavior when cache state is missing, stale, or unsupported.

3. Full-hook parallelization is expanded safely.
   - Lesson CLI fixture checks are classified through the existing parallel-group policy after confirming independent fixture state.
   - Keep unclassified or ambiguous checks serial.

4. Same-run evidence reuse remains scoped and fail-closed.
   - Same-run reuse for existing evidence-backed checks remains valid only when relevant hashes, command identities, repository state, and success status match.
   - Keep strict standalone commands available.

5. Duplicated policy-regression work between `CI` and `Lesson14 CI` is reduced.
   - Keep required workflow and job contexts unless developer approval changes them.
   - Main `CI` owns common policy regression work.
   - `Lesson14 CI` keeps compatibility contexts and lesson-specific gates without rerunning browser tests, `tools/test_lesson_repository.sh`, or full Git hooks.

6. `aggregate-and-full-hooks` internals preserve the optimized final-gate structure.
   - Evidence generation, evidence verification, and final-gap gate behavior remain covered by existing final-gate implementation and structure checks.
   - Preserve the externally required final guarantee that aggregate, full hooks, final-gap coverage, and evidence validity all pass.

7. Changed-only CI remains prepared for a future approval gate.
   - Keep changed-only observe-only in this implementation cycle.
   - Do not make changed-only authoritative until Coverage Guard, Result Attestation, full-CI comparison evidence, and developer approval are complete.

### Document Synchronization Policy

- Requirements state the guarantees, safety boundaries, and approval gates.
- Specification states policy-driven behavior, evidence validity, CI structure, and fail-closed behavior.
- Implementation plan states the implementation order, verification, recovery, and approval points.
- Task tracker records this as implemented work with final verification status.
- Handoff records the restart boundary for future test/CI acceleration work.
- The sync contract is `implemented` after runtime artifacts exist, tests are wired, and local plus remote verification pass.

### Verification Plan

The implementation cycle must run the related checks that already exist before and after changes:

```bash
git diff --check
./tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh
./tools/check_as_built_docs.sh
./tools/check_test_plan_coverage.sh
./tools/check_ci_workflow_structure.sh
./tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh
./tools/test_ci_evidence.sh
./tools/test_ci_final_gate.sh
./tools/test_git_hooks_parallel.sh
./tools/test_lesson_repository.sh
```

The implementation cycle adds focused tests when new behavior is introduced:

- CI workflow deprecation and action-version structure checks.
- Playwright cache-key and fallback tests.
- Parallel-group independence tests for newly parallelized checks.
- Same-run evidence reuse and stale-evidence rejection tests for new evidence types.
- Duplicate-policy regression prevention checks.
- Aggregate/final-hook split tests that prove no required coverage is lost.
- Changed-only observe-only metrics tests if metrics are added.
- `tools/test_ci_pipeline_acceleration.sh` is the focused standalone and aggregate-callable regression check for this cycle.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` recognizes the documented split between main `CI` common verification and `Lesson14 CI` compatibility contexts without accepting missing main CI coverage.
- `tools/check_as_built_sync_contract.sh` caches wiring lookups only within one checker process to avoid re-scanning the same evidence repeatedly; this is not persistent verification-result caching.

### Recovery Plan

- If a cache causes stale or CI-only failures, narrow the cache key or remove the cache step.
- If parallelization causes nondeterministic output or shared-state collisions, move that check back to serial and update the policy row.
- If evidence reuse is ambiguous, disable reuse for that command and rerun the strict check.
- If job splitting affects required check names, restore compatibility contexts and request developer approval before changing names.
- If changed-only appears to skip required coverage, keep it observe-only and fail the new guard.
- If any existing-feature tradeoff appears necessary, stop and request developer approval with reason, impact, alternatives, and rollback path.

### Developer Approval Gates

- Approval is required before changing required CI workflow or job names.
- Approval is required before reducing full/no-cache scope.
- Approval is required before making changed-only CI authoritative.
- Approval is required before caching verification results across commits, branches, workflow runs, repositories, or users.
- Approval is required before adding flaky quarantine.
- Approval is required before accepting any existing-feature tradeoff; the approval request must state the reason, impact, alternatives, and rollback path.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Existing 7-day and 14-day flows still pass structure checks.
- Free Development Mode and Team Development/Docker are additive.
- Implementation preserves refactorability, ecosystem fit, reusability, and generality.
- No existing feature is traded away.
- Lesson-side tests pass without recreating `task-tracker-repository`.
- Product repository boundary, Git sync, and CI checks remain available for explicit real product operations testing.
- All as-built documents describe the same implemented state.
- Lesson repository test prints `Lesson repository test passed.`
- Every implemented developer-memory audit item is synchronized into the five planning/workflow documents and backed by a mechanical check.
- Planned developer-memory audit items are synchronized into the five planning/workflow documents without being described as runtime-implemented work.
